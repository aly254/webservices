				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new app has surfaced to combat loneliness amongst individuals that are self-isolating or are quarantining amid the coronavirus outbreak. The new app is called <a href="https://quarantinechat.com/">QuarentineChat</a>. QuarentineChat is a voice-app that allows users to chat to one another across the world that are confined to their homes without disclosing your phone number. According to its creators, Max Hawkins and Danielle Baskin, they came up with the idea of random phone-calls with strangers last year, but have since introduced the QuarentineChat as a feature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2566 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/telephoneandmask-1024x768.png?_t=1584357111" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/telephoneandmask.png 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/telephoneandmask-300x225.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/telephoneandmask-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Simply download Dialup to use the app, a “voice-chat app that connects you serendipitously to the people you want to stay in touch with” before you relate to others globally who are also dealing with the effects of coronavirus. Once your phone rings, users are paired randomly with another individual who they can have a conversation with.</p>
<p>Baskin and Hawkins told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/international?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a>, “It’s to bring magic and serendipity to a new reality where thousands of people are stuck inside alone for the next month all over the world.” They are referring to those specifically in quarantine. Additionally, to combatting loneliness, Baskin and Hawkins believe the app can be beneficial to those that are dealing with mental health issues where they cannot leave their homes and may experience stress as a result.</p>
<p>Baskin told Artnet, “It benefits people’s mental health to have random spontaneous connections – and it’s also fun,” adding that they added subtle humorous details such as elevator music to the feature which they hope will bring people small “moments of joy.” According to the co-creators, there are currently about 70 people using the service, but it can handle up to 20,000 people.</p>
<p>The voice-call service comes with new guidelines that have been imposed by the <a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO), which aim to help people that are suffering from mental health issues because of the coronavirus outbreak. According to WHO, those in self-isolation should “stay connected and maintain your social networks.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As it is the beginning of a new decade, we felt that we should be making healthy choices in the office with the intent of improving our overall health and well-being. Unfortunately, as we are going into March, we cannot say that we have held up to our end of the bargain. We thought that now was good enough as any to kick-start our initiative to improve our health or get back into a routine and keep us on the wagon.</p>
<p>Our Borne team members have curated a selection of the best health apps that are currently out there that could support us to stay on track, stay healthy, and become more active this 2020. Maybe you can join us for the ride?</p>
<h2><strong>Couch to 5K</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2554" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-you-feel-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="345" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-you-feel-300x293.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-you-feel.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 85vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>To get us off the couch, running is a great workout you can do just about anywhere. The problem we have is getting the Borne team to get the motivation to do it. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/one-you-couch-to-5k/id1082307672">Couch to 5K</a> app is a proven method, one that will take you from the sofa to running in a 5K in a matter of 9 weeks with no prior experience. The app allows you to track your progress and log your workout and log your routines via four motivation coaches that you can choose from. The motivational coaches will give you instructional cues alongside your music so it won’t disrupt your rhythm!</p>
<h2><strong>Nudge</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2555 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2-1024x709.jpg?_t=1583335547" alt="" width="484" height="335" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2-300x208.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2-768x532.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2-1200x831.jpg 1200w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/app6-tojpeg_1539351636964_x2.jpg 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 85vw, 484px" /></p>
<p>We feel like it is safe to say that we could all use a little nudge to stay on the right track when it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Luckily, that is exactly what <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nudge-for-clients/id605363055">Nudge</a> provides by allowing you to connect with your friends and challenge them. The app is conveniently integrated with all other health apps you may have on your device to generate an overall score for you based on your last 30 days of activity, which you can compare with your family and friends while working to improve your health. We find the manual logger is a great feature too.</p>
<h2><strong>HealthyOut</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2551 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/32e6f66a8047f027ddb0c199a21361af.png?_t=1583331306" alt="" width="543" height="282" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/32e6f66a8047f027ddb0c199a21361af.png 732w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/32e6f66a8047f027ddb0c199a21361af-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 85vw, 543px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that comes with healthy eating is the challenge of eating out. Most restaurants serve meals for pleasure, not for the health benefits. <a href="https://mobile.healthyout.com/">HealthyOut</a> helps you spot the better options on the menu and makes meal modification suggestions, so you won’t fill up on all the bad stuff. It lets you scour your local area for restaurants offering healthy plates, whether you’re looking for a meal that falls within a specific calorie range or one that adheres to your dietary restrictions</p>
<h2><strong>Fitocracy</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2552 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens-1024x568.jpg?_t=1583335083" alt="" width="554" height="307" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens-1024x568.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens-300x167.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens-768x426.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens-1200x666.jpg 1200w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fitocracy_best_gym_apps_iphone_screens.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 85vw, 554px" /></p>
<p>We have no problem grinding out a video game to get our character to the next level. What if you could treat your life like a character in World of Warcraft? That is exactly what the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fitocracy-fitness-collective/id509253726">Fitocracy</a> app brings to the table by helping improve yourself by completing tasks and earning experiences so you can ‘level up’ in real life. The app offers a host of workout routines and expert advice, along with a robust community of like-minded individuals to keep us motivated.</p>
<h2><strong>CarbsControl</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2556 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CarbsControl.jpeg?_t=1583340644" alt="" width="545" height="469" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CarbsControl.jpeg 593w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CarbsControl-300x258.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 85vw, 545px" /></p>
<p>Cutting back on carbohydrates is a great way to improve your overall diet and, in turn, make us feel healthier. CarbsCounter takes care of deciphering how many carbohydrates are in each part of your meal and helps you monitor your intake by automatically logging your nutritional details and providing you with a quick way to setting a carb goal for every meal. Pre-set categories make logging in your daily Starbucks order makes it that much easier.</p>
<h2><strong>Waterlogged</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2557 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/waterlogged-984x516.png?_t=1583340758" alt="" width="527" height="276" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/waterlogged-984x516.png 984w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/waterlogged-984x516-300x157.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/waterlogged-984x516-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 85vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>Drinking more water is rule number one when it comes to improving your overall health. The aptly-titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daylogger.waterlogged&amp;hl=en_GB">Waterlogged</a> is designed to help you track of the amount of water you drink every day by using photographs or basic metrics. The premium version of the app also lets you view graphs of your recent progress and send you water reminders. Which reminds us…drink up.</p>
<h2><strong>ShopWell</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2562" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4e93e046331419.5607d0d261523-300x233.png" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4e93e046331419.5607d0d261523-300x233.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4e93e046331419.5607d0d261523.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, we do not want to know the detailed nutritional facts of our desk lunches. But, what you put in your body requires more thought than what we probably give it. Since sometimes we do not want to do that thinking ourselves, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shopwell-better-food-choices/id393422300">ShopWell</a> to do it on our behalf. You scan the items that you would normally buy at the grocery store and let the ShopWell store produce a list of healthier alternatives for you instead. The app incorporates your specific goals like lowering cholesterol and avoiding specific allergens. With the help of these apps it looks like the wheels of the wagon will continue to turn through 2020.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, we wrote an article to help you answer the question of &#8216;What Next?&#8217;, when launch day finally comes around. The resounding answer? Well, an awful lot. There&#8217;s advertising to be planned, social content to be perfected and feedback to be responded to. But marketing doesn&#8217;t just begin when your app launches. The majority of successful mobile apps will have had a marketing strategy in place from the get-go.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our top tips for getting your marketing strategy in place before your app has even launched:</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Set Objectives</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launching a marketing campaign without any goals is like visiting IKEA on a Saturday afternoon without a shopping list. It&#8217;s not only a huge waste of time, it&#8217;s also likely to end in divorce. We&#8217;re not sure why or how, but take our word for it.</p>
<p>Set yourself an end goal and work backwards to figure out which campaigns to go with. These goals could include brand awareness, building an email list, reaching a certain engagement % on social media. Statistics are important and don&#8217;t just pull some numbers out of the air willy-nilly, actually put some thought into it.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re launching a mobile app or a chain of gluten-free, vegan restaurants, competitor analysis is an essential part of the process. You only need to watch one episode of <em>The Apprentice </em>to see how ugly things can get when the basics are overlooked, and competitor analysis is one of these basics.</p>
<p>Analysing your competitors involves evaluating anyone who does the same thing as you. Have a look at their marketing strategies, their target users, brand values, profitability, strengths and weaknesses in their campaign &#8211; the list is endless!</p>
<p>Ideally, competitor analysis should be done before the project even begins for two reasons. Firstly, to ensure there is actually a gap in the market for your project. In an over-saturated market it&#8217;s essential to determine your unique selling point, and researching other companies will ensure no one is doing the same. Secondly, it enables you to learn from your competitors successes and mistakes and avoid making the same from the offset. We all love a marketing fail, but as well as laughing at yet another monumental screw up, let&#8217;s try to learn from them.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Know Your Target User</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we had a pound for each time one of our clients had no idea what kind of person they&#8217;re targeting, well, I&#8217;d probably be on a beach in Mexico.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-perfect-meeting/">branding meetings</a> at the start of a project often include a target user profiling session. Put together a list of your users&#8217; goals and needs, which will help you when it comes to creating and targeting your campaigns.</p>
<p>Your product must help your target user accomplish their goals, whether it&#8217;s relieving boredom on their commute, finally managing to lose weight or finding a new partner.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Optimise Your App Store Page</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written multiple posts on <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-1-app-store-optimisation/">app store optimisation</a>, so we won&#8217;t go into too much detail here. All we will say is keywords, keywords and more keywords.</p>
<p>And we don&#8217;t want them stuffed into your app store description like an overfilled sofa cushion. They need to be delicately placed into your copy strategically and carefully &#8211; use the same care and consideration you would use to place strawberries on a slightly-underdone chocolate brownie. Have we been watching too much Great British Bake Off? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5></h5>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Start A Blog</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are often put off starting a blog as they believe they can&#8217;t write. If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in my life it&#8217;s this; you do not need to be able to write well to start a blog. Sure, it helps. But my morning scroll through Medium&#8217;s top stories has taught me that running a successful blog is so much more than just being able to write well.</p>
<p>It is not knowing your similes from your metaphors or using a synonym for every word you type. It&#8217;s about personality and actually useful advice. Blogging will help you to build the hype around your brand, target specific people and bring traffic to your website. Plus, it gives you something to do while your app developers are busy writing 6 months worth of code in a windowless basement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Build A Social Presence</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting to build a brand without a social media presence is definitely possible, but you&#8217;re likely making your life more difficult. If you&#8217;re not social savvy enough to manage your own social media profiles, it&#8217;s worth getting someone else in to help. These days millennials know their way around a Twitter feed better than they know their way around their own town (I&#8217;m allowed to say this &#8211; I&#8221;m a millennial), and most of us only require enough money to get our weekly avocado toast fix.</p>
<p>Social media profiles are an excellent way to make your brand appear more &#8216;human&#8217;. Twitter allows brands to quickly respond to feedback and complaints, while Instagram can provide a valuable &#8216;behind-the-scenes&#8217; insight into the creation of your app. Social profiles are essential when it comes to building a pre-launch &#8216;buzz&#8217; around your product &#8211; think sneak peaks or giveaways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile app development is not always smooth sailing.  There&#8217;s only so much you and your brand new Macbook Pro can do, and unless you are highly skilled in market research, mobile app design, code writing and QA, you may need a bit of help!</p>
<p>But trawling through google trying to find the perfect <a href="http://borneagency.com/">mobile app development company</a> can be time-consuming and, let&#8217;s face it, a tad boring. Perhaps there&#8217;s the temptation to throw in the towel and abandon your idea altogether. But if you&#8217;ve got something good, it&#8217;s worth sticking with. We&#8217;ve seen entrepreneurs go from zero to hero, and it looks fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Mobile App Agency or Freelancers?</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to freelancers, app development agencies bring a depth of multi-disciplinary experience to your project. The combination of specialism and size may ensure the company is in a better position to deliver a larger scale project, however if it&#8217;s something simple like a logo design, hiring a freelancer could be more cost effective.</p>
<p>Our team have put together a failsafe guide to hiring a mobile app development company. Regardless of the size of your project, these top tips will help you to hire the right team for you, ensuring your product gets the best possible start in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1: Ask Around</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of our own clients come to us via referrals. Start ups often overlook the size of their network, and there is no better way to find the right app development company for you than through word of mouth.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the world of tech by attending some start up events &#8211; for those of you who are London based <a href="http://www.tech.london/events">Tech.London</a> is a great place to start. Network with other entrepreneurs and discuss their experiences have been with different companies. Even if they don&#8217;t have experience with mobile app developers specifically, they are bound to have some useful insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2: Show Them You Mean Business</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do you have to make sure that the app developers are the right people to take on your project, you also have to be a good fit for them. At Borne, we only take on projects which we can see the client is passionate about, and only if they have a well thought out plan for the future. We encourage our clients to think of us as partners and work with us on a one-to-one basis. Let&#8217;s just say, if we met our clients at the pub on a Friday night, it wouldn&#8217;t be awkward.</p>
<p>So, we recommend spending some time preparing for your initial meeting with answers to any questions you think that you might be asked. Bring with you a list of apps you enjoy using with the reasons why in order to help the team get a sense of what you are like, as well as designs you love. We tend to know what apps we enjoy using, but working out <em>why </em>is a different matter. Is it the ease of use? The colour scheme? It&#8217;s worth putting some thought into these in order to make the kick off meeting as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p>Arrive at the meeting with a clear description of what your app is going to be, how it will benefit the user, and a list of features the app must have. Arriving prepared allows the design and development team to see that you have actually taken time to think through your idea.</p>
<p>If the developers can see you are serious, they are far more likely to take on your project. Take the time to go through everything with your potential development team, ensure no stone is left unturned and the development process will run a lot more smoothly.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 3: Look At Their Previous Work</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you should never sign an app development contract without seeing examples of the work they have already produced.  You wouldn&#8217;t invest money in a house you haven&#8217;t seen, and with app development, the stakes are far higher (or maybe it&#8217;s only us who think that).</p>
<p>A good mobile app development company should have excellent UI/UX skills, but don&#8217;t just take their word for it. It&#8217;s worth downloading some of their apps to see how they actually work, as opposed to just nodding along to a selection of screenshots.</p>
<p>The apps should have great designs with excellent user interfaces. Pay attention to the small features, such as how neatly text fits into boxes and whether the buttons line up. Is the app easy to use? The tone consistent? It&#8217;s all in the detail. Little inconsistencies can ruin the whole feel of your app.</p>
<p>If possible, check client references. Look for app developers who can give you details of their previous clients. Ask these clients about the company&#8217;s ability to work to a deadline, overall value for money, general feedback and their willingness to recommend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 4: Cover All Bases</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never sign anything until you know exactly what services you will be paying for. Some app development companies will only develop, others will only design and some will do it all, from brand identity to QA testing.</p>
<p>Most clients find they want the same development company working on all aspects of the project. It ensures the team really get to know the brand, the design and the target market and would be in a better position to offer help with <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-post-app-launch-priorities/">post-launch marketing</a> if required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>Tip 5: Be Specific</u></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of being specific cannot be overemphasised. Without a clear understanding of the direction you want to take your project, there is very little your mobile app developers can do.</p>
<p>A good development company will listen intently to your project pitch, take notes and ask insightful questions, even bringing up potential problems your project may face before they arise.</p>
<p>When presented with a business requirement document, ensure you go through it thoroughly, line by line, before signing anything. This is no iTunes terms and conditions, a BRD is serious stuff and deserves your time. The more specific you are at the initial stages the better, as it means less changes will have to be made (which will cost you time and money) further down the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Be Realistic </span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App development doesn&#8217;t come cheap. It&#8217;s a huge investment which is why it&#8217;s so important to ensure you choose the right company. It is important however, not to be driven solely by price. Selecting a mobile app development company because they offer you the best price is not a good idea, and you may find that they cut corners further down the line.</p>
<p>While budgeting is highly important, cheaper options can end up costing more in the future. Don&#8217;t get ripped off, but don&#8217;t be a cheapskate either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Consider A Local Agency</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not completely necessary, choosing a development company local to you can make designing and developing your project a hell of a lot easier. We regularly have clients come in to see us, sometimes to talk about the app, sometimes just for a decent cup of coffee and a chat about how our day is going.</p>
<p>All to often, feedback and comments can get lost in a stream of emails, making everyone&#8217;s lives more difficult. Plus, you can never really determine anyone&#8217;s true feelings via email, and there&#8217;s always a chance that something will get misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 7: Listen To Feedback</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your developers are friends, not foes. In an ideal world, the development team should give you feedback wherever possible, and it&#8217;s important that even if you don&#8217;t agree, you still take what they say onboard. Although you may disagree on certain aspects of the project and they will do their best to accommodate your preferences, remember that if you&#8217;ve hired the right app developers, they will have experience in creating <em>successful</em> apps. They will know the current trends in the App Store, the sorts of design that works and most fitting colour scheme for your brand. In fact, if your mobile app developers are quiet and repeatedly accommodating throughout your project, that&#8217;s when you should worry. No one&#8217;s idea is <em>that </em>good.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on giving constructive feedback to our clients, guiding them wherever possible into making the best decisions for their project. If you have a large team of app developers, ensure they give feedback on your idea and listen to what they have to say. Actually listen.</p>
<p>Chances are, they know better than anyone what works best and will want your app to succeed as much as you do.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 8: Have A Post-Launch Plan</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood, sweat and tears have paid off and now hooray, the app is finished! Although&#8230;it&#8217;s not finished.  It&#8217;s far from finished.</p>
<p>Your app is never actually &#8216;finished&#8217; and ensure your developers know this. There is always more to be done, whether it&#8217;s fixing bugs, developing new features for users or starting work on version two.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss maintenance and updates at the beginning of the process. Then, once the app is signed off and launched, get to work on making it even better. Having a maintenance plan in place at the start of the project means no one is caught off guard.</p>

It&#8217;s time to settle down with a glass of Pimms and spend the next two weeks pretending to be a tennis expert from the comfort of your sofa (or actually go to Wimbledon if you&#8217;re organised).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our favourite time of year has come round again! It&#8217;s time to settle down with a glass of Pimms and spend the next two weeks pretending to be a tennis expert from the comfort of your sofa (or actually go to Wimbledon if you&#8217;re organised).</p>
<p>Last year we wrote a <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/wimbledon-new-technology/">post</a> all about the technology used at our favourite summer event, and this year we have decided to do the same (thoughts on making this an annual thing?). The technology used at Wimbledon does a great job of showing just how much the industry is growing, and we can&#8217;t help but wonder what 2020 might bring!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our quick roundup of all the fancy tech you can experience at both the courts and at home &#8211; when you&#8217;re not sipping pimms or celeb-spotting that is.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ask Fred</span></p>
<p>Enabled by IBM Watson, Ask Fred is the Wimbledon chatbot, available to attendees via the Wimbledon app.</p>
<p>Ask Fred will be able to answer a variety of questions, from where to eat or drink to where to buy a Wimbledon towel (priorities). Three public WIFI hotspots have also been added to the grounds which is great for those of us who tend to use up all our data sending smug Snapchats to our desk-bound friends.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Artificial Intelligence</span></p>
<p>IBM have delved into the world of artificial intelligence this year, introducing an AI-powered system which was tested at the 2017 Masters golf tournament in April.</p>
<p>The system will create a &#8216;cognitive highlight&#8217; reel after each game, based on what it deems the most exciting and dramatic moments of the tournament.</p>
<p>In past years, the post-match highlight reel would have to be manually selected by a producer monitoring the footage, so this is a big step up for the AELTC. The technology will make its decisions based on several factors such as the number of aces played, speed of the ball and breakpoints, but it will also analyse human behaviour. Loud cheering and reactions from a player which are different to their norm (it will also have access to past matches) will be noted. The clips are then ranked and formed into a two-minute highlight video, available to viewers approximately 30 minutes after each match.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Augmented Reality</span></p>
<p>If you fancy getting up close and personal with your favourite players then this next one is for you &#8211; as the club will be unveiling  a 360-degree video of the Wimbledon practise courts!</p>
<p>Visitors and fans will be able to get a detailed insight into how the players warm up and practise, while also discovering more about their favourite players. This &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; technology looks set to be a huge hit with hardcore tennis fans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Makes Great?</span></p>
<p>Another technology set to wow the public this year is IBM&#8217;s &#8216;What Makes Great&#8217; solution.</p>
<p>The technology uses historical data to identify key performance measures against a set of topics required to make a great champion. Providing fans with far more than just various tennis skills, What Makes Great wlll take into account mental attributes such as passion and performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Analysing over 50 million tennis points ranging as far back as 1990, over 6000 newspaper articles and 11 million words worth of social media commentary, What Makes Great is for anyone who&#8217;s interested in what makes a great tennis player and for anyone who fancies themselves as a Wimbledon champion in the future!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology In Sport</span></p>
<p>Advances in technology are having a profound impact on the way the public experience large sporting events, and it&#8217;s great to see it happen first hand through an event as exciting as Wimbledon. Could AI in sport be the way to make advanced technologies more accessible to the public? We think it just may be! Keep an eye on our blogs page.</p>
<p>Let us know if you pay a visit to Wimbledon this year and what you think of the latest tech!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s Wordwide Developers Conference kicked off yesterday and the event was, as expected, filled to the brim with new features, major announcements and not-so-subtle attempts to put Google back in their place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of the event so far:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HomePod</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Apple&#8217;s Siri speaker is finally here (well, in December).</p>
<p>It looks like an old Mac Pro, stands at a modest 7 inches tall and is powered by the A8 chipset. Users can use it in the same way they would Amazon Echo or Google Home, but Apple&#8217;s HomePod has a few little extras to make it stand out.</p>
<p>HomePod uses the A8 chip to monitor the space in the room and change its sound accordingly. The &#8216;Musicologist&#8217; feature works alongside Apple Music and can be accessed by talking to Siri &#8211; who can now handle complicated questions, play music on demand or send iMessages..</p>
<p>It will be available in black and white, and costs $349. A valiant effort but so far we can&#8217;t see it knocking Echo off the top spot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iOS 11</span></p>
<p>This is a big one for us as, let&#8217;s face it, we could spend hours exploring Apple&#8217;s latest iOS updates. Like every year, Apple showcased their latest iOS update and got the tongues wagging of mobile app developers all around the globe.</p>
<p>Packed full of new features, iOS 11 definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Siri&#8217;s voice is now much less robotic thanks to machine learning, and it&#8217;ll use on-device learning to improve users&#8217; iOS experiences. Siri will also speak in another language for you, which is great news for the 80% of Brits who communicate with non-English speakers by speaking English with a slightly foreign accent.</p>
<p>Siri is also learning to predict the users&#8217; next moves and will offer suggestions based on previous behaviours. It&#8217;ll learn interests, suggest related topics in News or will add related words to QuickType suggestions.</p>
<p>Other features in iOS 11 include the addition of person-to-person payments in Apple Pay and the ability to send money through iMessages. Photos and videos will take up less space, and a long exposure mode is being added to the camera. Apple Maps will be updated with lane guidance and speed limits displayed, as well as indoor maps of department stores. Users will be able to see what their friends are listening to on Apple Music (this has the potential to be mildly embarrassing), and the App Store is getting a total redesign and will look a lot more similar to the current layout of Apple Music.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WatchOS 4</span></p>
<p>Apple are adding several new faces, including a Siri face to the WatchOS 4. This face will automatically display the information which is most important to you and simply lifting your wrist will display this relevant information. This face will provide traffic information, reminders, news headlines and other location/time specific information.</p>
<p>The activity app is also getting updated. New workout challenges will be added, alongside a high intensity interval training mode. While we&#8217;re sceptical about the actual usefulness of fitness watches (read more <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">here</a>), we&#8217;re glad to see Apple doing their bit to combat the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>However the most exciting feature of the WatchOS 4 is the Toy Story-related watchfaces. The new faces will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz Lightyear, and if that&#8217;s not the best piece of techie news you&#8217;ve heard this year than you need to take a long hard look at yourself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacOS 10.13 High Sierra</span></p>
<p>Although a bit of a mouthful, the new version of macOS has a number of useful improvements. Photos will be easier to sort through, with Apple allowing users to filter them by order or tag. Photo editor will also be much more user friendly, with new tools available such as Curve. Updates to Safari will help to block site trackers &#8211; meaning you won&#8217;t be plagued with headphone adverts for 10 months after you&#8217;ve actually bought the headphones.</p>
<p>Updates also include Apple&#8217;s new file system, APFS, which will make moving files around much quicker and simultaneously free up space.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.5 Inch iPad Pro </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually software that is announced at the WWDCs, so whenever a new piece of hardware is introduced, our app developers and designers will spend the next few days deciding who&#8217;s going to take one for the team and buy it first.</p>
<p>This year, Apple introduced the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro, featuring a 12-megapixel camera and a 7-megapixel selfie camera, alongside 10 hours of battery life. The large screen allows for a full size onscreen keyboard and it also supports HBR video. Apple Pencil will be more responsive thanks to the new ProMotion feature &#8211; which increases the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz.</p>
<p>Finally it features a six-core A10X Fusion Chip with a 30% CPU performance improvement and a 40% graphics improvement. Notes has a built in document scanner and tapping with the Apple Pencil will lead you directly to the Notes app.</p>
<p>The 10.5-inch iPAd Pro will start at 64GB and costs $649.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iMac Update</span></p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s updated the iMac line which has gone down a storm with our app designers who are already whipping out their credit cards while committing themselves to a life of porridge and packed lunches. The new line includes an iMac 21.50inch and iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inc, with better storage, screens and the latest Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen processors.</p>
<p>The latest iMacs are shipping now but don&#8217;t be too hasty, as Apple also announced the high-end iMac Pro with with a Space Grey finish, a 27-inch screen, 18 cores in its processor and 16GB of VRAM. Start saving!</p>

<p><u>Have An Engaging App To Begin With!</u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re hoping that before you even start developing your app you will know its purpose, but this is something to keep in mind to ensure you don&#8217;t go off track.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As mobile app developers, we are always reiterating to our clients how important it is that the app actually adds some sort of <em>value </em>to their user&#8217;s life. Whether that&#8217;s by eliminating boredom on the bus, helping them find the <a href="http://www.getstreats.com">best places to eat in London</a>, or managing their finances &#8211; each app must serve a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An app simply cannot succeed if there is no clear use for it. You can have the best UI design, complex features and a million pound marketing budget; but if your users are not immediately hooked, it&#8217;s likely that your app will eventually be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So our number one tip for making sure users keep returning to your app? Have an app that&#8217;s good in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seamless On-Boarding</span></p>
<p>A quick and simple on-boarding experience is essential in reducing abandonment rates. Asking for too many details or making sign-up confusing will result in users throwing in the towel and deleting your app, possibly to never return to it again. It&#8217;s essential that your sign-up is as pain-free as possible for the user.</p>
<p>Seamless on-boarding means only asking for essential information and not confusing your user with too many features or too much text. The user should be able to sign-up in very few steps. Remember, this is the part of the app where you really cannot afford to make any mistakes. Users may forgive a small niggle later on, but as during sign up they have not yet discovered what your app can actually do for them, they are far more likely to abandon it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Engage With Your Users!</span></p>
<p>App engagement is a two way street &#8211; you cannot expect users to engage with your app regularly if you do not respond to them, and we don&#8217;t<em> </em>mean a generic &#8216;you haven&#8217;t logged on in a while&#8217; pop-up!</p>
<p>Used in the right way, push notifications and reminders are a great way to keep your users engaged and ensure that your app is always in the back of their minds. Pushing strategies should, of course, be <em>user </em>centred, and not just a blind stab at encouraging them to open up your app &#8211; irrelevant or &#8216;spammy&#8217; push notifications are more than likely to end in a rage quit.</p>
<p>Specific reminders or incentives however, are a good place to start. Take advantage of user data &#8211; such as location or interests. These will allow you to tailor your notifications to each specific user, ensuring they are are relevant, personal and, most importantly, actually useful.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listen To Feedback</span></p>
<p>User feedback is hugely important when it comes to keeping your app up to date and in tip-top condition. Don&#8217;t just rely on the testing provided by your app development company &#8211; they are more likely to focus on ironing out the bugs and polishing off certain features. Realistically, there is no substitute for feedback from people who will actually be using your app, so <em>listen </em>to any comments you are given and respond to it. Updating content, adding new features and refining your UI regularly will be sure to keep your users interested.</p>
<p>Tracking which screens or features may cause users to drop off is another essential. We recommend using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/">Firebase Analytics</a> to monitor user behaviour within the app and see which features may or may not be working.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage Social Sharing</span></p>
<p>We write a lot about the <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-2-using-instagram-to-drive-downloads/">power of social media</a> when it comes to driving downloads, but it can also be used to increase user engagement.</p>
<p>Allow users to easily share their progress or results on Facebook and you guarantee both a higher engagement rates and more visibility for your product. A great example of this is by fitness app <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>. After each run, the user is asked if they wish to share their running stats to Facebook or Twitter. Doing this will have a number of effects. It will inspire a healthy dose of competition in your user&#8217;s friends, ensure that the name of your app reaches people who may have similar interests, and also encourages your user to keep returning in order to impress their friends and followers!</p>
<p>Another great option is to offer incentives for sharing. Many games offer points or access to secret levels if the user shares their progress on social media, and this is definitely something to consider. If done correctly, these incentives will increase user engagement and continue to drive downloads, as more people want in on the action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1149" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Browse-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-20-at-16.23.54.png" alt="mobile app developers " width="719" height="561" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been scrolling through Instagram, downloading a workout or manically swiping right on Tinder (hey, we&#8217;ve all been there) and stopped to wander how these apps actually came to exist then read on.</p>
<p>This post will explain the ins, the outs and the methods used in mobile app development. We could spew out some complicated tech jargon to make us sound intelligent but luckily, we&#8217;re not like that. The point of this blog is to emphasize that anyone really can create a winning app &#8211; all you need is imagination, dedication and a couple of app developers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Every app development company will vary in their services offered, but they will all follow roughly the same formula when it comes to developing the product. This blog will explain our processes, how we work with our clients and the methods we use to turn a single idea into an app so addictive it gives people thumb cramp.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Work</span></p>
<p>We use the Waterfall Model in all our projects &#8211; which sounds a lot more glam than it really is. Essentially, this allows our clients to stay involved, as we are regularly providing them with a set of deliverables. They can keep up to date with the progress of their project and make sure that we are working to their standard, timeline and specifications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Do We Even Begin?</span></p>
<p>So many people have an idea for a great app, yet are never given an outlet to produce it. They aren&#8217;t confident in their idea, don&#8217;t understand tech talk or, in many cases, simply have no idea where to begin.</p>
<p>In our initial kick-off meeting we attempt to extract these great ideas (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t involve surgery). We want to get the ball rolling, the creative juices flowing and the ideas bouncing back and forth. We&#8217;re aware this sounds very hap-hazard and hipster, but trust us, it works. We even provide sweets just in case we&#8217;re not quite buzzing enough on tech talk.</p>
<p>When we have settled on something more concrete, our Project Manager will begin structuring the project, making sure the app is both feasible and possible. A first app should be the minimum viable product or MVP (we will write more on this in a future post), so the PM&#8217;s job at this stage is to stop the client getting too carried away adding more and more features. We&#8217;ve seen the &#8216;kid in the ice cream shop&#8217; scenario happen too many times, and trust us, it never ends well. The temptation to add something else is always there, so we need to make sure that what we develop really is the MVP, something which can be expanded on once we have some real user feedback.</p>
<p>From here, the PM will put together the functional spec. This contains a full list of the app&#8217;s features. It needs to be thoroughly examined by both client and developers, to make sure the requirements and timeline match up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design</span></p>
<p>Once the functional spec has been signed off on both sides, we&#8217;re ready to start creating the product. Our two Lead Designers, Elliott and Cris, are creative and passionate &#8211; skills which more than make up for their average to poor levels of office banter.</p>
<p>The design is done in two parts. We begin with the UX (user experience), which is the most logical representation of the functional spec. Don&#8217;t panic, this will not look like the real thing. Or, if it does, we can only apologise. Full UX design with a list of the functionalities is for the Developers mainly &#8211; they&#8217;re an extremely intelligent bunch and see things in a different way to the Average Joe. We will deliver the UX design in a user-friendly format to the client. Once that has been signed off we can get cracking with the next phase of design.</p>
<p>UI (user interface) design is where the fun really starts. This is where all the client&#8217;s branding, artistic and colour scheme dreams come true (there is no judgement here for dreaming of colour schemes). We want to achieve the right look and feel of the product, so our Designers work closely with the client to make sure it looks as close to how they envisioned as possible. Now and again the client pops in to see us, which we like to think is because we are great people to be around, but it&#8217;s just because we have really nice coffee.</p>
<p>Once the UI design is delivered and signed off, there are high fives all round and we might even make the Designers a cup of tea. After that: development begins (cue dramatic music).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation &amp; Verification </span></p>
<p>It is a common misconception that testing is done at the end of the project, however we&#8217;re firm believers that we should identify and fix unexpected results at each stage of a project, rather than allowing problems to escalate &#8211; resulting in nervous breakdowns all round.</p>
<p>The development and testing phase of the project is where everything starts to get a bit techie and, depending on the size of your app, this can take anything from 4 days to 1 year.</p>
<p>The first step in the development process is for our Front End Developers to translate the visual design laid out by our designers into a clickable prototype. A clickable prototype does what it says on the tin, you can move between screens and experiment with transitions &#8211; however none of the functionality has yet been applied.</p>
<p>Following this we work to implement some of the more basic API endpoints such as registration and profile creation before releasing an alpha build to the client. An alpha build will still be very &#8220;raw&#8221; but will have passed stringent QA acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Only when the app passes our QA team&#8217;s extremely high standards and the core functionality is in a usable state will we release the first build we consider a &#8220;beta&#8221;. The beta stage is the first chance to start testing the full flow of a mobile application, from registration through to completing all user journeys. Stress testing continuously to mimic real world usage; at this stage we will be looking for bugs, unexpected behaviour and crashes.</p>
<p>There is usually a large amount of work to do between the first beta build and an app that is fit for the app store, often an app will go through multiple beta releases that progressively get closer to your launch specification. Only once all the bugs have been ironed out will the build be considered &#8220;launch ready”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance<br />
</span></p>
<p>Just because the app has launched doesn&#8217;t mean the work is done. If the client signs a maintenance package with us, our PM will develop a plan with weekly sprints to develop and support all features of the product. If something goes wrong, we are onto it. From here, the client can start collecting some analytics and stats, helping them to plan for the second version of their product.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Version 2</span></p>
<p>They say you only start really learning to drive once you&#8217;ve passed your driving test and the same could be said for apps. Once we get some real user feedback we can work out what we can do to make it better, and that is when we start work on version 2. This also is the time for the client to start adding in some new features, think about monetizing their app if they haven&#8217;t already, and gain some insights into how users have been responding so far.</p>
<p>We hope this post has encouraged you and made you realise that mobile app development isn&#8217;t quite as complicated as it may first appear. Please <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact/">get in touch</a> if you want to know a bit more about the services we offer, or just fancy a chat about how your day is going.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, getting the name of your app out there has become harder than getting a seat on the Northern Line in rush hour. To put it simply, there are too many people trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>When the App and Play Stores are dominated by the likes of Tinder, Candy Crush and Instagram, it can be hard to find your feet. But it’s important to remember that even the top downloaded apps started out as mere ideas too. With some clever marketing, nifty tricks and a quick look at the tactics of those who have absolutely smashed it, you will be able to gain exposure for your app before it’s even launched.</p>
<p><u>Be Different</u></p>
<p>From collaborating with an unexpected brand to running a marathon dressed in an iPhone outfit (kudos to RunKeeper for this!) there’s a number of ways that you can gain exposure for your app in ways that could excite, confuse or intrigue your potential users.</p>
<p>For an example of this we will look to the horribly addictive Angry Birds. In 2011, Angry Birds set up a real life game in the middle of Barcelona. Locals and tourists used smartphones to control a real life slingshot while a live band played the music featured in the game.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not possible to do something as huge as this when just starting out, but by doing something a bit different, Angry Birds landed media coverage on hundreds of blogs and videos of the life-size game were widely shared online. Anything that gets potential users talking, sharing or hash-tagging is a win when it comes to marketing your app.</p>
<p><u>Create A Teaser Video</u></p>
<p>Teaser videos started as a nice touch but have now become something of an essential.</p>
<p>A bit like a movie trailer, you can be as creative or as wacky as you like. But remember, sometimes simplicity wins (everyone remember Flappy Bird?). Having a video showing either a demo of the game or a sneak peek will make users excited. Humans are predominantly visual and love to be shown something as opposed to simply told about it.</p>
<p>Although you may have to put some money aside for creating and promoting the video, if it manages to spark interest and increase engagement, it’ll be worth it.</p>
<p><u>Appeal To What People Love</u></p>
<p>Just a quick glance at Facebook and Twitter trends and you can get a pretty good idea of what people are loving when it comes to social media.</p>
<p>A company who did a great job of appealing to the masses was Uber, who took advantage of National Cat Day. The company’s campaign UberKITTENS was used to promote adopting animals from shelters as opposed to breeders. On National Cat Day, users in a number of US and Canadian cities were able to hail an UberKITTEN to their office, with 15 minutes of cuddle and playtime with a kitten costing $30.</p>
<p>Uber nailed this campaign for so many reasons, many of which we can learn from. They worked alongside something people love, and that is, cat videos. We are all guilty of logging onto Facebook with the intention of replying to a message and being lured into a four-hour cat video binge. Uber knew this, and they played up to it.</p>
<p>National Cat Day is the day that users are posting about cats, tweeting about cats and thinking about cats. What better way to gain exposure for your company than actually giving people real life cats to play with, photos of which they will no doubt share on social media? Hats off to UberKITTENS, they absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Two takeaways from this hugely successful campaign? Do your research and make sure your timing is impeccable. UberKITTENS would have worked almost any day of the year because, let’s face it, it’s adorable. But the fact that it was National Cat Day just heightened the campaign’s success. There is no point launching a fitness app two weeks before Christmas! New Year’s Day on the other hand couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate &#8211; just make sure you follow our app launch series to help you beat the competition!</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing your app there is no better advice than have fun, get creative and be different. The users will come running. Check back in next week for the next part of our app launch series!</p>
