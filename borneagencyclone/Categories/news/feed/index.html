				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been an increased global demanded for a more personalised mobile experience, so a widespread adaption of deep learning and AI in the mobile app development industry is inevitable. We can forget about latency issues that crop up in cloud computing and mobile sensing. Close to zero latency is here, with real-time data processing speeds which delivers optimum results.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Bionic smartphone chips by Apple, built-in neural processing units help neural networks run directly on-device at an amazing speed. Using Google’s ML Kit and Apple’s Core ML, deep learning libraries like Keras and TensorFLow Lite, our developers can create products with fewer errors, faster data processing and lower latency.</p>
<p>A huge advantage of on-device machine learning is that it can offer users an accurate, seamless user experience. Since you do not have to question if data has been sent for processing, you will get an improved privacy, data protection and user security. Also, with neural networks on mobile devices, you do not need to connect to the internet to access every feature of your app. By using mobile device computing capabilities to implement deep learning, it has greatly improved mobile device usability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why You Should Be Incorporating Deep Learning Algorithms:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Augmented Reality and Immersive Capabilities</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore platforms, developers can build AR apps that can juxtapose digital environments and objects with realistic settings. Mobile-based AR’s immersive capabilities are having a significant impact on entertainment, travel, retail and other industries. Looking at brands Like Sephora or Lacoste, they allow their customers to try on products with AR apps and a growing number of shoppers prefer to check out products on their phones before taking the plunge, especially in today’s times where people can try things on in-store. Interactive AR games like Ghostbusters World, Ingress and Pokemon received a cult following and received extensive press. Also, if you’re looking for navigation, Google Maps Live View will provide you with real-time navigation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong>On-device machine learning has made things easier in complying with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It guarantees security in your data, as you don’t need to upload encryption, biometrics or to a cloud or server for processing.</p>
<p>On-device automatic encryption is another useful smartphone feature that protects your content with a pattern, password, PIN and allows access to your data only when you unlock your phone. This way, if your device is stolen or it is lost, the chance of someone having access to your data is negligible. The iPhone’s Face ID feature is an example of a more secure smartphone experience. The on-device neural networks in the Apple smartphone chips process and safely store user facial data. The identification happens on the device, so your security and privacy remain unimpeded. Google Pixel 4’s Face Unlock tech, uses 3D IR depth mapping to create your face models for face recognition and stores them on an on-device Titan M6 security chip. Face Unlock works well with the 1Password app which offers users biometric security by eliminating the chance of fraud identity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Speech Recognition</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Speech recognition involves transducing or transforming input sequences into output sequences using recurrent neural networks (RNN), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and other architectures. Developers struggled with the issue of latency which will create delays between the automated assistant’s response and the request given. But, we can get around this by using the compact recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) tech in mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>RNN-Ts are sequence-to-sequence models. Rather than following methods that have been followed previously of processing an entire input sequence before producing an output, however, they maintain a steady continuity in their input processing and output streaming. This facilitates the processing of real-time speech. We can see this in Google Assistant, which can process consecutive voice commands without faltering and without requiring you to say ‘Hey, Google’ after before each request. This creates a more conversational flow, and the assistant will follow your instructions precisely. Want to find a photo in one of your folders? Looking for a guided route to a friend’s place? Consider it sorted.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2639 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/digital-barriers-facial-recognition-technology.jpg?_t=1590139940" alt="" width="920" height="533" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/digital-barriers-facial-recognition-technology.jpg 920w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/digital-barriers-facial-recognition-technology-300x174.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/digital-barriers-facial-recognition-technology-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>High Quality Photos</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High quality photographs are an important criterion for buyers when selecting smartphones, which they can get with many of the latest models. These come equipped with the hardware components: image central processing units (CPUs), image signal processors, deep learning image algorithms, and neural processing units that have catapulted smartphones into a new realm from traditional cameras.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Accurate Image Recognition</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you pair on-device machine learning with image classification technology, you can identify and receive detailed information in real-time with about anything you encounter. Looking to read a foreign language text? Scan it with your mobile device and get an accurate instant translation. See a piece of furniture that you are keen on? Scan it to get information about where you can buy it and the price. By facilitating image recognition in real-time, apps like Calorie Mama, Google Lens and Leafsnap are increasingly mobile’s devices’ usability and learnability and enhancing user experience.</p>
<p>The possibilities of on-device machine learning are endless. With the increase of efficient intelligent algorithms, increase in power for AI chips and deeper neural networks, digital products incorporating deep learning mobile will be the expected standard in retail, banking, health care, data analytics and various other industries. As deep learning capabilities continue to improve, mobile devices’ usability features will evolve alongside and will continue to flourish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like other sectors that we have spoken about, the financial sector has recognised the potential for digital solutions, strategies and developments that are changing the face of our current economy.</p>
<p>However, digital ecosystems require more than just adopting change. To achieve resounding success, the institutes should go through structural reforms across external and internal processing systems. Organisations are now investing in technology to speed up their business endeavours as well as to differentiate from their competitors in the financial sector. Fintech is attracting customers with convenient services and products that have emerged from a single-source technology.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can the Financial Sector and Digital Transformation Integrate? </strong></h2>
<p>The transformation brought in by the digitalisation is more on the customer-front experience. The digital growth is directly proportionate to the convenience a digital product can provide to its’ customers. For example, credit companies and banks are now providing mobile facilities and experiences to their customers and eliminating hassles of visiting a branch for petty transactions and formalities. However, financial institutions like capital and equity markets still rely on age-old systems that run on IBM frames.</p>
<p>By taking a customer-centric approach, financial service providers are aiming to make their customer’s lives easier and unlocking opportunities in the functions of the financial domains like the capital market, credit facilities and banking. Using the right mediums of tech, the financial sector could outgrow their efficiency and surpass their own records when a successful implementation of the digital workforce can take place.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact of Finance and Digital Transformation</strong></h2>
<p>It goes beyond making digital products progressive and reaching out to their clientele, the Fintech industry takes digital transformation to develop an ecosystem of business models that call for an equality of participation from all corners of the sector.</p>
<p>Beyond the teams of people, the transformation majorly takes place in the capitalisation of new tech that could further enable the introduction of digital tools to enhance efficiency and productivity in the financial sector. An example of this is the transition from hardcopy documents to secured HTML or PDF formatted documents. Keeping in mind, it does come bearing risks of its own. The advent of cashless payments, mobile banking, and e-wallets have hiked the security threats cases recently. Tasks like making journal entries, depositing bills, allocations and receiving operations can now be assisted by replacing human involvement with robotics.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2621 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-1024x683.jpg?_t=1589184626" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The financial sector has come up with strategies to implement automation and digitally transform the process. The act of automation comes with a set of regulations and rules that assist in achieving the high-performance goals and mitigate the operation risks.</p>
<p>Being strict on the guidelines of the applications, Fintechs must move on the lines of improved customer segmentation. Secondly, the enhancements in the design of products, services and promotional capabilities can shift from physical channels to a digital platform. The repetitive tasks like reports, analysis, accounting and similar operations can now be executed with robust strategies of the tech that minimises the errors and possibility of cyber risks.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Tools</strong></h2>
<p>There are specific tools for Fintech that serves the industry with systems focused on improving the existing systems that have been put in place.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2620 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0.jpg?_t=1589184591" alt="" width="960" height="709" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0.jpg 960w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0-300x222.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0-768x567.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Visualisations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Data storage is a key area where there are multiple departments have struggled to maintain a uniformed funnel. The data visualisations gain insight by tracking the performance and trace the interactions that can forecast or predict current or future performances. This can be utilised to base decisions for profound improvements in the next stage of development.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Robotics </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction of robotic automation in the financial sector brought down the communications and processes to a minimum. Tasks like allocations, depositing bills and making journal entries can now be assisted by robotics and assist human involvement. Though the implementation is still in testing phase, banks have started installing bots at the entry gates of the branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The tech expedition has come up with the introduction of cloud computing. The financial sector took the advantage to enable effective interdepartmental collaborations using <a href="https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/drupal-saas">SaaS-Based cloud applications</a>. Tasks such as Human Resources and accounting is included in this and the core systems were incorporated and integrated. However, for functionalities like billing, payments and credit scoring, the same cloud structures cannot be used because the risk of personal data breaches cybercrimes is so high.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blockchain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The preferred tech in the financial sector is <a href="https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/can-drupal-and-blockchain-work-together">Blockchain</a>. This amalgamation ushered financial services in a new digital era in its truest form. Blockchain has empowered a new form of currency called cryptocurrency where the set of blocks of data is considered as a currency that you can exchange online. This is a breakthrough and the financial sector sounds promising as it limits the chance of fraud, addressed money laundering and this effectively pumped trading measures in the financial market. However, Blockchain has a long way to go and challenges to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Analytics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are various sectors in finance itself and it becomes a task to channel the massive influx of customer data. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is leveraged to effectively use advanced analytics that can anticipate customer behaviour. The algorithms of machine learning can identify the customer trends and analyse an online pattern that can be put to their advantage. For example, the apps store more frequently used services and then give suggestions based on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Does the Future Hold for Fintech?</strong></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/04/five-key-takeaways-from-the-2019-state-of-digital-sales-in-banking-report/">a study conducted in 2019</a>, 65% of banks have reached or are on the path to digital transformation. The two-dimensional platforms that serve both parties involved, advisors and clients, will take on these advancements. It will empower and shape the ecosystem by embracing new tech and tapping into the digital maturity of most today’s customers. With each new phase, the customers are also bridging their knowledge gaps on a learning curve of tech. It is only a matter of time before we witness a blooming of the financial sector where digital tools are used to bring an improved customer experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we face the tough challenges that come with our wellbeing in the workplace or working from home, we have found that some of these tools for managing our mental health and stress levels to be helpful.</p>
<p>If you are working in the charity sector, it is a rewarding sector that unites people with a passion for people and progress. However, we understand that you face challenges at work that affects your wellbeing. The healthcare and charity sectors face specific challenges, especially with the uncertain times that we are currently in. Charity and healthcare workers face major deadlines, the need for accountability and keen regulations which can induce stress and impact your mental health. A significant source of stress is money as the NHS and charities are largely dependent on donations, government funding and raising their own revenue. The threat of dwindling funding and cuts can add to the issue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2602" style="width: 712px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-2602 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712.jpg?_t=1587372858" alt="" width="712" height="399" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712.jpg 712w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Mental Health First</strong></h2>
<p>The significance of focusing on your mental health is gaining ground in discussions in the workplace. Healthcare and charity staff are emotionally invested in their jobs but don’t always have the support network that is needed. Putting self-care first is essential for employees, service users and the organisations themselves. It is all well and good putting your all into it, but burning out is not good for you as an individual, and this is not good for the organisations or the people that are using the organisations.</p>
<p>There are challenges that are distinct in managing self-care for managers and directors in the charity and healthcare sectors. Whether facing bereavement in cancer patients, helping survivors of domestic abuse or supporting vulnerable refugees, the healthcare and charity sector staff face distressing and traumatic situations regularly as part of their daily working life. The tendency for the healthcare and charity sectors to depend on part-time staff, volunteers and teammates working remotely also raises wellbeing issues.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Cloud Nine Online</strong></h2>
<p>As the health sector works to boost mental health, we find trends that start to emerge. With our busy lives that are hyper connected, there are digital tools and products that we can make use of to help. You can start by using search engines like Google to find information on websites like <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a> or the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> website for accurate information. You can reach out and connect with people going through the same thing through online communities, like <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/support-community-elefriends/">Elefriends</a> too. They are sometimes described as online <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information/peer-support/peer-support-directory">peer support</a>. You can also find therapy is available online, too.</p>
<p>Although social media is known to exacerbate feeling low or the need to compete with the ‘perfect’ lives posted by other people, it can help you to feel better, tools. As social media is a bit of a free-for-all, try to be careful and take care of yourself by limiting time or exposure. Connecting with friends and family through social media can aid your wellbeing.</p>
<p>Vlogs, blogs and podcasts also help people connect. You can find this content on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://bloginstructions.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogspot</a> and YouTube. Watching or reading other people’s experiences can create solidarity and provide reflection in your own feelings. Get your creative juices flowing and create your own vlogs, podcasts or vlogs during lockdown and turn off the comments to avoid negativity.</p>
<h2><strong>In the UK specifically,</strong> <strong>the </strong><a href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/HEE-Topol-Review-Mental-health-paper.pdf"><strong>Topol Review</strong></a><strong> noted several key tech solutions that are poised to impact the charity and healthcare sector for the next 20 years:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Remote Consultations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Remote consultations are having a profound impact on mental health provisions. Telehealth services allow practitioners to increase capacity and improve access to service for patients that might be in logistically or geographically underserved communities. Offering remote services improves the convenience for patients increasing the likelihood of them accessing appropriate services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Sensors/wearables</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to monitor patients and generate data relating to their conditions and activity is becoming more widespread across the healthcare sector. Continuous, real-time monitoring activity, stress levels, sleep patterns, heart rate etc. provides a much more detailed picture of people’s overall lifestyle. As these devices become more sophisticated, they are providing the ability to more accurately identify risk factors.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Digital therapies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mental health represents a huge growth market for digital therapeutics. Already the profession has access to some of the most evidenced therapeutic programs provided through digital channels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Electronic health records (EHRs)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>EHRs support mental health practitioners across so many aspects of care. The ability to accurately document patient conditions, progression, efficient treatment and progression. These systems also enable data-driven decision making, consistency, ensuring quality across care pathways.</p>
<h2><strong>Big data and Machine Learning </strong></h2>
<p>The rise of analytics and big data across all industries are offering increasingly accurate patterns and trends, and the charity sector and mental health is no exception. The correct analysis of data and large pools such as online searches can offer valuable insights into data trends that can impact the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.</p>
<p>Examples of organisations that are making use of this are the <a href="https://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/"><strong>Black Dog Institute</strong></a> who are leading the way for health research in Australia. The idea is that by analysing data from sources that individuals use in daily life like social media and blogging, it will identify possible individuals who are showing signs of mental illness. By profiling these social media interactions, identifiers and new markers of mental health may provide invaluable real-time insights into mental health patterns that have the potential to revolutionise prevention and treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Mental Health and Stress Apps We Are Loving</strong></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no industry that is immune to technological advances, but traditionally real estate is one niche that has been slower to adopt new trends. This is no longer the case. Proptech is booming and it is shifting the way we sell, buy and interact with our properties. Significantly more companies are looking to digitally transforming in their industry space. As the traditional real estate market has been really shaken by the global pandemic that is COVID19, the traditional real estate sector will have to adapt moving forward into the future once lockdown has been lifted.</p>
<p><strong>Here are our top 5 trends that we at <a href="https://borneagency.com/">Borne</a> have seen over the course of 2020 so far:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Big Data  </strong></h2>
<p>The property management and real estate industries are uniquely positioned to benefit from using big data within the industry because the more data we have, the more data-driven decisions we can make safely. Websites like <a href="https://www.redfin.com/">Redfin</a>, <a href="https://www.trulia.com/">Trulia</a> and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> have disrupted the real-estate industry by using big data effectively. These companies can compile and collect data on selling and buying trends in an area, demographic information, consumer survey results and traffic and many more to collate and analyse that data to offer insights on pricing, home-value trends and potential value in specific neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>For property managers and owners, big data is about gathering historical and real-time information about all kinds of building systems — like HVAC, fire/life safety, electrical, utilities and telecommunications — and using this information into proactive maintenance. In some cases, it may even alert a property manager to an equipment failure before it even happens which allows for minimal downtime. This will keep both property managers and tenants happy!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2593 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/imagen_1_10.png?_t=1586357015" alt="" width="868" height="629" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/imagen_1_10.png 868w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/imagen_1_10-300x217.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/imagen_1_10-768x557.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Machine Learning and AI</strong></h2>
<p>Machine learning and AI will help make the data collection process more actionable. For example, currently property search sites rely on simple preferences like size and location to display properties for sale; soon, however, AI may enable these sites to recommend properties based on personality traits, preferences and values.</p>
<p>Chatbots on these search sites may be able to answer consumer questions easily and quickly, and they might even accompany buyers to showings. Several companies are working on software that would allow estate agents to conduct showings via a chatbot or a tablet, allowing one agent to increase their showing potential in a day. AI will also be able to predict pricing trends more accurately. This type of tech would look at previous trends in the market, but also consider schools, area crime, marketplace activity and transportation. This would also make the buying experience easier and faster. Startup companies are already creating ways to digitise the entire home-buying experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Augmented and Virtual Reality</strong></h2>
<p>A survey was conducted by the National Association of Realtors, nearly half of all potential homebuyers search for properties on the internet first. Augmented and virtual reality will make the home buying and online search experience even more accessible and enjoyable. Realtors can create virtual tours of properties for potential buyers which could also help long-distance buyers virtually tour a potential property. Staging is a great way to increase the perceived value of a property, but it can be expensive. Companies like <a href="https://rooomy.com/">roOomy</a> are expanding the online buying experience by allowing realtors to virtually stage a property by digitally adding accessories and furniture to interior photos.</p>
<p>For new builds, VR can create realistic architectural images and walkthroughs to help buyers understand and experience the property, even before construction begins. And for the property managers, creating a VR tour of the space may help tenants get acquainted with the property. Instead of providing lengthy packs of documents on how to use the thermostat, a virtual tour could quite literally walk the tenant through the process, demonstrating each step along the way.</p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things</strong></h2>
<p>The Internet of Things refers to “smart” appliances and devices that are digitally connected to the cloud, constantly receiving and sending information. Machines that include smart sensors can alert property managers and owners to potential problems and even allow for predictive maintenance. But in the future, homebuyers may be able to download a comprehensive history of a home’s upkeep and maintenance through its smart devices. These sorts of devices also help with energy efficiency and can crate real cost savings for the property owner or home buyers.</p>
<p>As the IoT grows, we’ll go beyond individual smart devices and start seeing entire smart buildings that are constantly connected, receiving and sending data. This will pave the way for AI, machine learning and big data to create even more improvements and insights we may not even be able to predict yet.</p>
<h2><strong>Drones </strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2592 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UAVs-help2-1024x683.jpg?_t=1586356919" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UAVs-help2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UAVs-help2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UAVs-help2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UAVs-help2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Drones may seem a bit gimmicky in the property sector, but they are not going anywhere and they do have the potential to change the market.</p>
<p>Multi-perspective and digital site visits are now possible, creating emotional storytelling around a property for its’ potential buyer. They provide relatively budget-friendly and easy aerial photography for displaying bigger properties and homes, giving a feel for the real size of a place. Drones can also be used to spot potential maintenance problems, which could lower the price or be used in negotiations of the property. Some drones may even be used to tour a property remotely. But for large industrial sites or commercial areas, the potential is significant.</p>
<p>Real-estate professionals and property should not ignore technological innovations. PropTech trends are just the beginning of the wave of changes and improvements to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Coronavirus has thrown us into uncertainty and the constant flow of news that we are exposed to can feel overwhelming and relentless. All of this can take a toll on your mental health, especially for those already suffering with anxiety disorders. So how can we protect our mental health during times of isolation and uncertainty? Being concerned about what is going on in the news is understandable, but for many it could make panic worse.</p>
<p>Here are some of our tips to protect your mental health while working from home:</p>
<p><strong>Limit Your News Intake and Be Cautious About Your Choice of News Sources</strong></p>
<p>Having a constant bombardment of news outlets on social media and through apps such as the BBC News app can feel overwhelming. For some that are more prone to anxiety, it can feel like everything is spiralling out of control. Having long periods away from news sites and social media can help you manage your anxiety. Mental health charities like AnxietyUK also provide a helpline should you feel overwhelmed and need someone qualified to talk to.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit the amount of time you spend reading or watching things which aren&#8217;t making you feel better. Perhaps decide on a specific time to check in with the news</li>
<li>There is a lot of misinformation swirling around &#8211; stay informed by sticking to trusted sources of information such as government and NHS websites</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2580 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-248533-1024x683.jpg?_t=1585235174" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-248533-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-248533-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-248533-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-248533.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Social Media Breaks </strong></p>
<p>Clicking on hashtags and seeing unverified news stories can make someone anxious and hopeless at the given situation. Be careful about which accounts you follow and limit yourself on the number of times a day you click on the COVID19 hashtags. Take the time to Mute key words which might be triggering on Twitter and unfollow or mute accounts. Muting Facebook posts and WhatsApp groups if you find it overwhelming.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Maintain Connections With People </strong></p>
<p>Make sure you have the right phone numbers and email addresses of the people you care about. Agree on regular check-in times with your colleagues and loved ones so you feel connected to people around you. Strike a balance between having a routine and making sure each day has some variety.</p>
<p>It might end up actually feeling like quite a productive two weeks. You could work through your to-do list or read a book you&#8217;d been meaning to get to.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid burnout</strong></p>
<p>With months ahead of this pandemic, it is important to have down time. Continue to access nature and sunlight where possible. Exercise regularly, eat well and stay hydrated.</p>
<p>AnxietyUK suggests practising the &#8220;Apple&#8221; technique to deal with anxiety and worries.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge: </strong>Notice and acknowledge the uncertainty as it comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Pause:</strong> Don&#8217;t react as you normally do. Don&#8217;t react at all. Pause and breathe.</p>
<p><strong>Pull back:</strong> Tell yourself this is just the worry talking, and this apparent need for certainty is not helpful and not necessary. It is only a thought or feeling. Don&#8217;t believe everything you think. Thoughts are not statements or facts.</p>
<p><strong>Let go:</strong> Let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don&#8217;t have to respond to them. You might imagine them floating away in a bubble or cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Explore: </strong>Explore the present moment, because right now, in this moment, all is well. Notice your breathing and the sensations of your breathing. Notice the ground beneath you. Look around and notice what you see, what you hear, what you can touch, what you can smell. Right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else &#8211; on what you need to do, on what you were doing before you noticed the worry, or do something else &#8211; mindfully with your full attention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.snapchat.com/l/en-gb/">Snapchat</a> is rolling out a new feature called Here For You earlier than anticipated to help users who may be feeling stressed or anxious over the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-GB/news/post/introducing-here-for-you">Here For You</a> tool was first announced in February, and it is designed to surface “safety sources” from mental health experts when users search for topics like depression, bullying or anxiety. Of any social media platform, Snapchat have the youngest demographic of users where 90% of its users falling into the 13-24 age bracket who are vulnerable to bullying specifically.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2573 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Here-For-You.jpg?_t=1584721709" alt="" width="400" height="868" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Here-For-You.jpg 400w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Here-For-You-138x300.jpg 138w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Snapchat has now added a coronavirus-specific section to the tool “that will provide Snapchatters from the Ad Council, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO), <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> and other partners who are creating content on anxiety specifically related the coronavirus outbreak.”</p>
<p>The original release date was set for April; however, Snapchat expects the feature to be available to users next week. The feature was informed by studies that show that connecting with loved ones and friends is the best defence in fighting against anxiety and loneliness. They have also found that Snapchatters are deeply interested in understanding these issues and how they can support their friends and loved ones during this difficult time.</p>
<p>While most of us are going through periods of self-isolation, when working from home in these conditions it may feel like you haven’t got the same support that you are used to. <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, Google and <a href="https://teamsdemo.office.com/">Teams</a> are a few examples of apps that provide options for multi-person video calling to establish a strong support system. A few minutes a day talking to your colleagues face-to-face could really boost some people’s mental wellbeing. Keep talking!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2574 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Video-Call-Facetime-Chatting-C-109535270.jpg?_t=1584721785" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Video-Call-Facetime-Chatting-C-109535270.jpg 800w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Video-Call-Facetime-Chatting-C-109535270-300x150.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Video-Call-Facetime-Chatting-C-109535270-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The consensus coming from the authorities is to distance yourself as much as possible and stay away from groups of people. We cannot recommend enough leaving occasionally to take a walk outside or go for a run. Maintain your distance from others, but the benefits of fresh air are huge. It is worth noting that there are excellent mediation apps and guided breathing apps like Headspace or The Breathing App which are free to download. They have been proven to help reduce stress and introduce a greater sense of control. Mental health charity Mind advises people to keep your brain occupied and challenged – so why not download <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/"><strong>FutureLearn</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw09HzBRDrARIsAG60GP9rzAe6FyLJ2MovQNwvSXqBREXH4h7m7Grnyv3h4DQB2V905BGNlXkaAs4EEALw_wcB"><strong>OpenLearn</strong></a>? You can hone some new skills – and even take a course in disease outbreak prevention.</p>
<p>With schools closing this week, it may seem a little daunting to figure out how to keep your children entertained during working hours. Try downloading your local library’s app, it may lend a helping hand in these times.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2497 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/london-taxis.jpg?_t=1574941138" alt="" width="615" height="346" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/london-taxis.jpg 615w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/london-taxis-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Over the past few years, Uber have been under threat in the city of London. TFL have released statements that they believe that the company are not “fit and proper” to run a transport service that functions with the safety of their clientele in mind. It is more than likely that Uber will make tweaks to their platform to win back the favour and license from TFL, however it is without a doubt that alternatives need to be addressed and made use of should the future of the app remain uncertain.</p>
<p>There are currently numerous alternatives to Uber that are available in the London market. These alternatives may offer services that differ from the Uber model, however most of them still rely on the same venture capital-backed business model. Here are some of the apps that can get you from A to B safely with the convenience that Londoners crave:</p>
<h2><strong>Gett UK</strong></h2>
<p>Israeli startup <a href="https://gett.com/uk/">Gett</a> differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a flat rate pricing scheme, and works with licensed taxi drivers. Mainly working with black cabs, its corporate services are available in 135 countries. Gett is unique in that it was listed as one of the first ride-hailing app with the option to book exclusively electric taxis, with Gett also incentivising its drivers to invest in hybrid or electric vehicles. CEO Matteo de Renzi has stated that the key selling point for their business model is for business travellers to have the option to order electric and executive vehicles. Also, they can integrate a client’s preferred vendors into the platform.</p>
<p>Gett has not hit the brand familiarity and popularity levels that Uber has progressed to in the UK yet. However, it is a serious competitor as Uber faces an uncertain future in the UK. Gett is available across the UK in major cities such as London, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Bristol, Manchester and many more.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2498 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DXiFC-KW0AAn9Fv-1024x512.jpg?_t=1574941318" alt="" width="840" height="420" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DXiFC-KW0AAn9Fv-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DXiFC-KW0AAn9Fv-300x150.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DXiFC-KW0AAn9Fv-768x384.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DXiFC-KW0AAn9Fv.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Free Now</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://free-now.com/uk/driver/">Free Now</a>, or previously known as Hailo and Mytaxi, is a Europe-wide app which operates in Brighton, Edinburgh, London, Oxford, Reading and Manchester and claims to have ten million users on their platform. What sets them apart from Uber, is their sole use of licensed taxi drivers that have access to bus lanes legally. They claim to have a two-minute waiting time so you can get where you need to go quickly and safely.</p>
<h2><strong>Taxiapp UK</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.taxiapp.uk.com/">Taxiapp</a> is a UK non-profit co-operative owned company that is operated by black cab drivers themselves. Like bigger ride-hailing counterparts, it is a free app that allows you to locate and order a black cab while tracking its progress. It is also convenient and easy to make an advanced booking through the platform. Payments can be made through the app, card or cash-in-hand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2499 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e0907fb0-0a27-11ea-b7f5-4ec9224047bf.jpg?_t=1574941415" alt="" width="800" height="574" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e0907fb0-0a27-11ea-b7f5-4ec9224047bf.jpg 800w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e0907fb0-0a27-11ea-b7f5-4ec9224047bf-300x215.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e0907fb0-0a27-11ea-b7f5-4ec9224047bf-768x551.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Kabbee </strong></h2>
<p>Kabbee offers an app as well as a website to provide a taxi-price comparison service, which also lets you book and pay in one place. <a href="https://www.kabbee.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiA_f3uBRAmEiwAzPuaM-0Viwuam4SjFm7-7OEI4fTOS-ZT1GE1VQRtBApqLMpLNe8Ps2gXFxoCaKAQAvD_BwE">Kabbee</a> claims that their rides to the airport are cheaper than those that Uber offers. An advantage to having a fixed fare cost in place would help you avoid surging prices if you are stuck in traffic so you won’t need to watch a meter tick up.</p>
<h2><strong>Bolt </strong></h2>
<p>Bolt, formerly known as Taxify and Hopp, the Estonian firm has relaunched in London as<a href="https://bolt.eu/en-gb/"> Bolt</a>, which promises lower fares for passengers and higher-take-home pay for drivers. Bolt also offers safety features which Uber has struggled to provide in the past. These safety features include an in-app “panic button” for both drivers and passengers. The ‘SOS’ service contacts the Metropolitan Police directly when it is activated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in the Human Resource industry. These changes have been shaped through many contributors, however tech has seen a shift from a paper-based system to imbibing technology in the recruitment process.</p>
<p>Talent pioneers in the Talent Management industry have recognised the importance of using new technologies to their advantage. This includes analytics, cognitive, VR and AR to reinvent organisation and hiring techniques as well as AI. With AI, the Talent Management industry can reinvent and transform their processes to progress in this fast-paced sector.</p>
<h1>AI and its Effect in the HR Landscape</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talent Acquisition has seen the greatest improvement using AI. It is in this area that the HR sector sees the greatest impact in measurable results in the reduction of time to hire individuals, increase productivity rates and, most importantly, delivering the best candidate experience to their clients.</p>
<p>The success of this originates from a virtual recruitment bot that is powered by AI. This can be used to conduct candidate screenings that are applying for a specific job role that may receive a high-volume of applicants to the role. This bot can easily shortlist candidates of interest by screening CV’s based on the required skills for the job role and respond to those accordingly. It can also be used to answer basic enquiries which allows recruiters to spend more time on other tasks instead of answering to FAQs.</p>
<h1>
Support in Compensation Decisions</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI in Talent Management and HR tech help HR professionals and employers to make well-informed professionals to make the best decisions which are based on the insights provided. This can be beneficial in compensation. Up until recently, most organisations would go through external and internal data points which makes sense out of the obtained data and then marking the right amount. Through AI, data can be accessed easily, contextualised and interpreted then sent to the HR professionals. However, the decisions must explain itself so that the employer involved can make the final call on whether to follow the advice provided.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2466 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pexels-photo-221164-1024x683.jpg?_t=1572516106" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pexels-photo-221164.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pexels-photo-221164-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pexels-photo-221164-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h1>A Personalised Experience</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboarding processes can be significantly improved using AI. New employees who do not know which people to connect with can the information needed with AI-powered programmes. The program can also provide documents for newly-hired employees which contains useful information such as organisation guidelines and training modules.</p>
<h1>Analytics of People</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large corporate bodies have a significant amount of data of a sensitive nature that is gathered by their employees. AI plays a large role in HR with the support of people analytics to analyse, track and manage people. An improved digital IQ can shed light and provide deeper insights of the employees’ statements, intentions and mood. Human behaviour can be simulated through machine learning models. This makes it possible to validate employee experience regularly. This adds a new dimension to workforce strategizing to reduce pressure on employees. It is essential to maintain a balance of human and machine in the workplace based on talents and skills and AI is an integral part of maintaining this.</p>
<h1>Automation of Tasks</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of AI offers a significant opportunity to automate repetitive tasks that are of lower value to companies which allows for HR team members to focus their energies on recruiting, interviewing and onboarding.</p>
<h1>Administration</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI can assist in establishing digitised personal records and this allows employees to track and update throughout the duration of their employment. As HR has the important role of overseeing these records, it is important that they determine which information can be shared or not.</p>
<p>Platforms that are AI-driven allow employees to have access to their basic records and perform simple HR tasks themselves. These programmes assist in pushing specific data when it is required by a targeted set of employees.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>
Workforce Planning</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to the quality and expanding the workforce, HR has taken on the new responsibility. However, this requires specific skills. AI-based programmes, through data, the amount of wastage that is being exerted as well maintaining a streamlined approach. This allows for making informed decisions within the company sphere.</p>
<h1>Establishing Effective Compliance</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HR face one of their biggest challenges which is remaining compliant in their daily tasks. Regulations and policies are ever-changing and this requires a significant amount of data and paperwork.</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions and AI help streamline the process by providing storage capacity that is efficient and is easy to navigate sensitive and sometimes political-sensitive information that may be subject to compliance issues.</p>
<h1>
AI Adoption</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Embedding AI in your talent management agency may seem daunting. Start off slowly by adopting the Natural Language capabilities as it allows for employee interaction and get an insight into your company’s dynamic and workforce. It is a significant program where you can make decisions based on raw information and complex data. Also, you can focus on opportunities that will benefit your business by focusing on the important things and navigate your experiences, data, expertise and intelligent processes more efficiently.</p>
<h1>The Current State of AI in HR</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stats have shown, according to Deloitte, 40% of companies that were analysed have used some form of AI in their HR departments alone. According to Personnel Today, 38% are already making use of AI and 62% are predicted to begin this year alone.</p>
<p>AI is present in all major industries globally from legal to advertising and transportation. Having already witnessed the use of AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants and programmed systems in the workplace, the implementation of AI in HR and Talent Management offers a flexible and more user-driven employee experience.</p>

<p><em>“According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S. They affect 40 million adults, or 18.1% of the population, every year. Furthermore, anxiety disorders affect 25.1% of children between 13 and 18 years old, putting them at a much higher risk to perform poorly in school, engage in substance abuse, and miss out on important social experiences. Even though this disorder is highly treatable, only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment, most likely due to a perceived societal stigma, with men far less likely to seek treatment.”</em></p>
<p>Data Analytics and Big Data have the potential to offer a wide variety of opportunities to excel and improve the outcome of social and healthcare, specifically the mental health sector. In the last two years alone, 90% of the world’s data has been created and by 2020, there will be more than 50 billion smart connected devices in the world, collecting, analysing and sharing data.We are seeing a significant increase in the value of big data as it improves the quality of research and the actual diagnosis of mental illness and disorders. The complexity of the variables involved make it very difficult for psychiatrists to identify the causes and origin of a wide variety of mental health conditions. Because of this, there is a need for more powerful tools to create these relationships and identify patterns. This is where data analytics and big data comes in.</p>
<p>Two researchers that are heading the movement, Dr Claire Gillan and Associate Professor Robert Whelan, both funded by MQ.  Both collaborated on a research paper titled ‘What big data can do for treatment of mental illness’ which maps out the opportunities for big data as well as machine learning. According to statistics, one in ten people suffer with depression in the UK alone. Researchers have stated that big data could end the approach of trial and error when it comes to treatments. In a 2012 study, the Dr Rudolph Uher tested if specific symptoms associated with depression could be predicted on how effective an anti-depressant would be after a treatment duration of 12 weeks. When looking at patterns in a larger dataset, the team found out that symptoms such as inability to make decisions, loss of interest and diminished activity predicted a decreased outcome of antidepressant treatment. Understanding these results could significantly improve how healthcare practitioners could improve how we match interventions to a patient.</p>

<p>Adam Chekroud, of the Yale School of Medicine and his team have delved into the effectiveness of antidepressants. The study was conducted in 2016 which focused specifically on an antidepressant called citalopram. The team identified 25 variables that could be used to predict the treatment outcome which allowed for specific tools to be developed which could successfully forecast whether someone would respond positively with citalopram. Looking to improve how we prescribe treatment for depression, Dr Claire Gillan has collected significant amounts of data by inviting people that are living with depression to share their information and track their symptoms through an online platform. From this information, an algorithm is created. This innovation could revolutionise the treatment of patience as individuals instead of a collective whole. The amount of studies that are taking place.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Challenges?</strong></p>
<p>There are significant benefits on harnessing big data for mental health, so why isn’t it being used on a more regular basis? One of these challenges is that the studies mentioned as well as others have been difficult to scale. Medication requires specific evidence from a large group of people before investment into the collection of data. This also requires two groups, one to test and one to compare against and this may prove difficult to recruit for these studies. Another possible challenge is funding of these projects. Many experts feel that MRI’s product the best results for their studies into mental health as they can see exactly what is happening in the brain. However, MRI scans are costly as you would require specialised equipment and computer systems to analyse the data that is gathered. We need to focus funding into this research to harness the best results from this data possible.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What Can We Expect In The Future?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we don’t have one data source that is large enough and reliable enough to refer to.  However, we can get around this. Data scientists are discovering and creating models combine and link different data sources to provide authentic results. From MRI scans to genetic information, test results, doctor’s notes and pharmacy sales, as well as the statistics we obtain fro, monitoring tools and health apps – however, we need to fund and invest in data science if we are going to progress in furthering our understanding in factors that could make a difference.</p>
<p>If we utilise this properly, big data could help identify risk factors for mental illness, track how well people improve and get the right treatment for people with mental health conditions. It can also help us detect and prevent mental health conditions from developing. This should not be a futuristic add-on to mental health treatment and research. It should be a required part of understanding it.</p>

<p>Valerie Hawkett felt totally disorientated and terrified after her car had flipped into a ditch. After pulling her four-year old daughter from the vehicle, Valerie had no idea where she was and struggled to describe where she was once she had called the police. However, police officers could pinpoint her exact location using a new form of tech that assigns three random words for every 3m x 3m square on the planet.</p>
<p>After being sent the necessary web link by what3words, the system could take the words “weekend foggy earphones” and relay the exact location to the police officers so they could locate the vehicle. The words provided gave the officers the location of a field close to the A36 heading out of Norton St Philip, Somerset. The geocoding system what3words has divided the world into 57 trillion squares, with each of these squares holding a unique address. Somerset police are known to be one of the first in the UK to pilot the tech and Valerie Hawkett and her daughter are believed to be the first individuals to be rescued using this technology.</p>
<h2>How does what3words work?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2441 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w3w_about_global_grid_landscape-1.jpg?_t=1569228684" alt="" width="850" height="503" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w3w_about_global_grid_landscape-1.jpg 850w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w3w_about_global_grid_landscape-1-300x178.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w3w_about_global_grid_landscape-1-768x454.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>“The what3words app divides the surface of the planet into grids measuring 3 x 3m and makes use of an algorithm to develop a unique 3-word marker to the 57 trillion squares that have been created. This gives a simpler and precise locator marker that a grid reference that is lengthy. “</p>
<p>Humberside and West Yorkshire Police also use this system. The British Transport Police as well as three fire services in the northern sectors have seen the value in using technology to assist in rescues. Call handlers can send a text to the caller with a link to the page that generates their three-word address.</p>
<p>Various organisation has seen the value of this technology, including the UN. The UN use this tech for disaster relief. Another well-known company that have seen the potential in this are Mercedes-Benz, which recently launched the world’s first car with built-in What3Words voice navigation. This technology can also be used in crowded areas at festivals or beaches to let family and friends know where you are, should they get lost. This technology was created by British entrepreneur Chris Sheldrick, who found a gap in the market for something more specific than the standard postcode. Chris Sheldrick and his friend Jack Waley-Cohen, who is a mathematician, came up with the idea 6 years ago and spent one year developing the overall product. They made sure to have two different spellings and make sure that profanities are screened out. To generate the 57 million-three-word addresses, the company makes use of the cube root of the figure which is a whopping pool of approximately 38,500 words!</p>
<p>A member of the Avon &amp; Somerset Police, Sam Sheppard has noted that the way the police force has changed the way that they approach incidents when locations are unknown. He stated that they are moving away from the old-style of questioning such as, “What can you see?” or “Where are you going?”. These questions take too much time and are and could lack in accuracy. By asking for a three-word address and using the tech that What3Words provides means that police forces save valuable time locating the site of incidents and could save many lives.</p>
