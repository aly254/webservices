				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cities are becoming smarter than ever before, with a plethora of start-ups looking towards digital transformation and how we interact with city spaces in our everyday lives. The rise of the smart city, however, poses a new and potential difficulties for governments globally: as more services move online, and the nature of those services becomes increasingly complex, they risk becoming inaccessible to large groups of the population.</p>
<h2><strong>New Markets, New Opportunities</strong></h2>
<p>Digital product studios are working to solve this problem, and make cities smarter for those with disabilities. Not only are we focused on making existing technologies accessible, working to develop solutions to improve city life, specifically for those with additional needs has become an important factor that we consider when developing products for our clients. In making cities more accessible, local businesses and attractions also benefit, given that the consumer spending power of disabled people and their families is around<u> </u><a href="https://wearepurple.org.uk/the-purple-pound-infographic/">£249bn in the UK.  </a></p>
<p>In the ‘Accessibility Tech’ market, we at<a href="https://borneagency.com/"> Borne</a> found three broad categories of start-ups that are working to make cities more accessible for all their inhabitants: First, there are start-ups that make smart cities and their integrated technologies more accessible. Second, there is a collection of businesses that make using transport and navigating around the city easier for those with disabilities. Finally, there is a category of start-ups that are focused on making visits to shops and venues a better experience for those with accessibility needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting the ‘Access’ Back into Accessibility</strong></h2>
<p>Touch screens are used in a range of smart city solutions – from citizen engagement apps, to ticket kiosks to displays providing data collected by smart sensors. However, the information displayed on touch screens is not always accessible to those with visual or physical impairments. German start-up <a href="https://speechcode.de/">Speech Code</a><u> </u>and Spanish-based <a href="https://mouse4all.com/en/">Mouse4all</a><u> </u>are examples of changes that are possible to be more inclusive in digital product development.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2759 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what.jpg?_t=1593765348" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what.jpg 800w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-300x225.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speech Code makes touch screens accessible for those with visual impairments by providing technology that generates a QR-like code that holds the entire content on a given display. Once scanned with the free SpeechCode App, it presents the content – without Internet access – as text and/or in audio format. Mouse4All provides an app that allows those who cannot the screen by touching it with their hands to command the screen with an alternative input interface suited to one’s physical abilities, such as an adapted mouse, a trackball or joystick.</p>
<p>Buttons, which are also increasingly used on digital kiosks and sensors around the city, pose a problem for those with visual or physical impairments. The Button app, developed by startup <a href="https://www.neatebox.com/">Neatebox</a>, helps overcome this challenge by allowing users to press buttons, like those at pedestrian crossings, by using their smartphone.</p>
<h2><strong>Navigation and Transport</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>While<strong> </strong>apps like Google Maps, TripAdvisor and Citymapper have made planning journeys around the city much easier, these platforms are often not as useful for those with additional needs. The standard navigation apps often do not include information about accessibility or when they do it is incomplete or unreliable. When reliable accessibility information is included, it is often in the form of labels like ‘accessible or ‘inaccessible’, which</p>
<p>Apps like <a href="https://www.sociability.app/">SociAbilitiy</a> and <a href="https://www.accessable.co.uk/">AccessAble</a><u> </u>are aiming to provide an alternative to TripAdvisor and Yelp that do include detailed and reliable accessibility information about shops, restaurants, museums and other venues across cities in the UK and the US. Meanwhile, <a href="https://citymaas.io/">CityMaas</a> helps those with disabilities plan their travel to these venues by generating travel routes that include a range of accessible transport modes. If assistance is needed at any or all stages of the journey, the CityMaaS Assist will even help arrange that. Booking is taken care of in-app, and it covers everything from bike hire to the subway.</p>
<p>French startup <a href="https://www.wheeliz.com/en">Wheeliz</a><u> is</u> aiming to increase the amount of affordable accessible transport available by providing an Uber-style peer-to-peer user adapted car rentals service. Created in 2015, the website offers individual owners of an adapted car the possibility of renting it directly to a wheelchair user who needs it. Finally, UK startup <a href="https://www.wayfindr.net/">Wayfindr</a><u> </u>allows vision impaired individuals to navigate through transport hubs independently by providing auditory navigation cues. The cues are generated from bluetooth beacons placed in the stations which connect to the user’s phone and allow the user to receive the cues via the app.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2760 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-509722213_1.jpg?_t=1593765400" alt="" width="560" height="374" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-509722213_1.jpg 560w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-509722213_1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 85vw, 560px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Shopping and Venue Accessibility</strong></h2>
<p>Even when businesses or restaurants can be reached by accessible transport, visiting these venues once lockdown has eased can still pose challenges to those with additional needs. Often, visitors with accessibility requirements receive inadequate customer service due to lack of disability awareness and confidence of staff members.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neatebox.com/welcome-user">The Welcome app</a><u> </u>was to tackle this problem. Businesses can use the app to inform customers of their accessibility features, and users with disabilities can notify venues of their requirements before arrival. When a customer with additional needs notifies the venue of her intention to visit, staff receives information about their specific needs so that they can provide appropriate support once they arrive. <a href="https://www.handiscover.com/en-gb/">Handiscover</a> provides a similar solution for travel accommodation. Through the platform, consumers can search for and book travel accommodation based on various accessibility needs and communicate their needs with the provider before booking their trip.</p>
<h2><strong>Politicians are Listening </strong></h2>
<p>Multiple local UK governments and cities have explored how they can develop assistive technologies for local services over the past six months. Notably, in September 2019, The East London Inclusive Enterprise Zone, which is a £1.2 million (€1.4 million) project aimed at incubating and accelerating accessible innovation enterprises, was launched as the result of a collaboration between the Greater London Authority, Hackney Council, several London universities and non-profit organisations. More recently, there have been similar moves in specific sectors, from healthcare to education<u>. </u><a href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/c4fa0e63-d53b-4944-b4ae-c9bdc844de40?p=1">Northamptonshire County Council is currently tendering for enterprises to be part of an assistive technology framework aimed at technologies that support independent living at home</a>.</p>
<p>One start-up that stands out for its collaboration with the UK government is Wayfindr. The navigation system for the vision impaired was awarded funding through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-backs-small-businesses-in-transport-sector">Transport Technology Research Innovation Grant</a> and was given permission to trial its navigation tool on the London Underground at Euston and Pimlico station. These trials have been a success and the start-up has been starting to roll out its technology in the US, while also implementing further trials to see how its technology can be used in different settings like hospitals and airports.</p>
<p>No two disabilities are alike, and yet every person on the planet will eventually be disabled. How do you design a product for that problem? How do you anticipate those needs? It’s questions like this that should get everyone who cares about product development excited. Because they hint at what accessibility really is: a futuristic universe of design as diverse and multifaceted as humanity itself. Designing with empathy for fringe-use scenarios, as accessibility is sometimes described, isn’t just “the right thing to do” as a design studio. It’s the future of development and we should embrace that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Activists have been using the increased accessibility of specific technologies to drive the current surge in global dissent. Still, creative activists continue to respond, this is not only necessary but it necessarily is dependent on innovation and creativity for its existence. At the core of these rising numbers is the increased accessibility to advancement of specific technologies.</p>
<p>The mass mobilisations that have shown the most power have come from very specific marginalised communities. A <a href="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/revisiting-the-methods-of-nonviolent-action/"><strong>new study</strong></a><strong> </strong>has noted more than 300 methods of nonviolent resistance, representing plenty of innovation, specifically on the tech and digital front. And some of this technology has contributed to the record number of people participating in activism in the past couple of decadess namely, ones that help activists use mass communication tools more easily and cheaply. This, in turn, supports larger, dispersed, sometimes anonymous and therefore less risky tactics.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Mass Communication</strong></h2>
<p>Tech has increased in affordability, versatility and capacity — including video, photography and live broadcast capacity — have been the driving force behind DIY media and social media networks, digital memes included.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The ACLU app <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct"><strong>Mobile Justice</strong></a><strong> </strong>and Facebook Live not only enable campaigners to report from a hearing or demonstration in real time, but also to document the behaviour of law enforcement as it happens. Meanwhile, memes have become the omnipresent visual communication form of social media from Facebook to Twitter. Within some of these platforms, enclaves like “Black Twitter” have blossomed, using hashtags to connect slices of specific communities across the globe. From #NotMyPresident to #BlackGirlMagic to #MeToo and #FeesMustFall — hashtags are now a feature of our cultural landscape. The sheer volume of digital communications is notable.</p>
<p>The ability to live broadcast required expensive equipment and contracts for transmission. Smartphones of all kinds and the growing availability of broadband, as well as cell networks, have made live broadcasts and real time streaming accessible around the world. The implications of this have democratised who can report the news and who can watch whom, speeding up the news cycle even while providing almost instantaneous opportunity for activist mobilisation.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2702 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Mapping-1200x675-1024x576.jpg?_t=1591972270" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Mapping-1200x675-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Mapping-1200x675-300x169.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Mapping-1200x675-768x432.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Mapping-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Digital Mapping</strong></h2>
<p>Another widespread integration of new computer technology has fuelled the accessibility of data visualisation. Creative activists have used mapping in many ways to help <strong>“</strong><a href="https://beautifultrouble.org/principle/make-the-invisible-visible/"><strong>make the invisible, visible</strong></a><strong>”</strong> — often one of the first challenges that activists on complex, hidden or distant issues face. For example, many aspects of climate change can be predicted and shown by geographic area on<strong> </strong><a href="http://theclimateadvisor.com/the-best-climate-change-mapping-tools-for-you/"><strong>interactive maps</strong></a>, whether heat index, sea level rise, fire or drought risk. Activists working on indigenous and First Nations’ rights often find that current inhabitants have limited or no knowledge about the places they live. You can enter your zip code in the States into <a href="http://native-land.ca/"><strong>this app</strong></a><strong> </strong>and you can find out.</p>
<h2><strong>Drones</strong></h2>
<p>High-flying remote-controlled technology has been around for a while, but the advent of mass produced small, cheap and, therefore, accessible drones has opened a world of aeronautic protest and documentation for ordinary folks. It has included the<a href="http://time.com/5279322/drones-poaching-air-shepherd/"><strong> surveillance of game poachers</strong></a><strong> </strong>in hard-to-access, protected areas.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2701 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grey-quadcopter-drone-724921-1024x667.jpg?_t=1591972245" alt="" width="840" height="547" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grey-quadcopter-drone-724921-1024x667.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grey-quadcopter-drone-724921-300x195.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grey-quadcopter-drone-724921-768x500.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grey-quadcopter-drone-724921-1200x781.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></h2>
<p>Innovation and tech advances have made it possible to crowdfund solutions to seemingly intractable economic justice issues. Theoretically, the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/greek-bailout-fund.html"><strong>Greek Bailout Fund campaign</strong></a><strong> </strong>could have raised enough money to help Greece avoid austerity. On the other hand, an almost $32 millions of medical debt has been forgiven by <a href="http://rollingjubilee.org/"><strong>online crowdfunding</strong></a><strong> </strong>to purchase debt for cents on the dollar, and then forgive that debt. The <a href="http://nationalbailout.org/"><strong>National Bailout</strong></a><strong> </strong>program also provided direct relief through a mass donation to bailout black mothers and others affected by mass incarceration. In 2012 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17277156"><strong>Egyptian activists projected </strong></a>videos of military repression onto prominent buildings. Meanwhile, in 2018, Americans projected images of the slain journalist <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/10/21/us-news-museum-pays-tribute-to-murdered-journalist-khashoggi"><strong>Jamal Kashoggi onto a part of the Newseum</strong></a>, which has a quote from the first amendment. Part public service announcement, part luminous artistic statement, projections are used to glowing effect around the world.</p>
<p>An update on projection technology wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the world’s first <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/04/15/no_somos_delito_organizes_hologram_protest_spanish_gag_laws.html"><strong>holographic protest march</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which took place in Spain in 2015. The surreal threat of outlawed public protest drove artist-activists in the group<strong> </strong><a href="http://nosomosdelito.net/"><strong>No Somos Delito</strong></a> (We Are Not a Crime) to fight back in an equally surreal way. It was considered a big leap for how technology is used in activism. This current emphasis on infusing tech and humanity into activist campaigns is a gift to the broader movement for social justice truly addressing the radical and essential root of transformative work. Hopefully, when we look back at early 21st century activism, we will see the creative and cultural aspects highlighted above continue to be cornerstones of ever more effective people-powered movements.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What action can charities take to not only survive in these difficult times, but thrive?</strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology has undoubtedly driven demand from donors to be able to engage with charities online, from any device and at any time. Can it also be the route to deliver success for charities who manage to reimagine the way they respond to these threats? The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled the Scouts into shifting their approach on its future and responding to answers that draw on super-practical and creative thinking, so in short “Be Prepared” for uncertainty.</p>
<p>With face-to-face meetings currently suspended, the charity has had to accelerate its use of tech to provide different wats of providing operations that are rapidly transforming, delivering meetings and providing experiences. Responding to the COVID-19 lockdown, the Scouts revealed their campaign #TheGreatIndoors, a new online platform of activities and ideas to provide entertainment to children. Also, Scouts internal systems, already being readied for digital change, have accelerated towards progressive ways of working through tech.</p>
<h2><strong>Response to The Challenge</strong></h2>
<p>The chief digital officer for Scouts Lara Burns pulls no punches when explaining the challenge.</p>
<p>“We can’t do what we are here to do,” she says. “Deliver scouting to hundreds of thousands for young people across the country and help them develop skills for life. Our finances are stretched, which will potentially affect our ability to deliver scouting in the long term.</p>
<p>“Staff are working remotely. Board meetings have gone all-digital, and will not go back to earlier ways of working any time soon.” Burns says their rapid move to digital service delivery came from the “grassroots” rather than the centre. With most Scouts sites closed, the movement led the shift to ‘Scouting by Zoom, with volunteers delivering weekly online meetings locally. “At a national level, we used Zoom &#8211; and we’ve been able to repurpose content and launch amazing social action and fundraising campaigns” says Burns.</p>
<p>Operations for internal Scouts operations have also seen accelerated change. The charity was early to commit to trailing remote working in the very early days of the pandemic – so operations like payroll are running remotely for the first time which has allowed for employees to be away from the office for longer than 10 weeks. Another example of incorporating tech, a <a href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/events/all-members-online-meeting/">Scouts Zoom Leadership Team briefing</a><u> </u>offered a live Q&amp;A for no less than 14,000 Scout volunteers that was set up in 2 days. The organisation set out the digital platform options available to local volunteers wanting to offer services remotely, as well as all-important guidance on online safety.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2655 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-5.38.34-PM-copy-1.png?_t=1591017773" alt="" width="770" height="378" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-5.38.34-PM-copy-1.png 770w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-5.38.34-PM-copy-1-300x147.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-5.38.34-PM-copy-1-768x377.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a> was rolled out securely to the entire Scouts organisation in just 2 weeks, as opposed to the four months that were originally set aside, which allowed collaborations and meetings to continue organisation-wide. In their digital team, Scouts has been able to on-board five new starters virtually, who had all joined after lockdown had been initiated. An example of a project created through Teams was <a href="http://www.scouts.org.uk/hiketothemoon">Hike to the Moon</a><u>, </u>a major fundraising effort from Scouts to virtually ‘hike’ 240,000 miles to the moon, which raised an amazing £688,000 for those affected by the pandemic. “</p>
<p>Regardless of the sector, digital transformation is underway in many organisations, as companies exploit the opportunities presented by digital technology to build their brand, connect with customers, and enhance sales models.</p>
<p>Digital transformation certainly has the potential to transform the way the charity sector works, enabling it to do more with less. While this requires charities to be open to rethinking the way they operate, the benefits are clear – improved productivity, a recharging of intelligence across the organisation and a charity ready to be reshaped for future change with an ecosystem of innovation and integrated technology.</p>
<p>Charities often have complex workforces. As well as their own employees, many have hundreds, if not thousands, of disparate volunteers working remotely so data fragmentation can be a real threat. Charities can reassess possible disjointed processes across the fundraising journey and unlock silos of information that act as blocks to the way they work. The benefits that charities would be implementing are compliance and productivity gains.</p>
<h2><strong>Thriving, Not Just Surviving</strong></h2>
<p>In this age of disruption and uncertainty, charities are under more pressure than ever before. It is therefore vital that they have the space to think differently and look afresh at their systems and working practices. However, while most UK charities understand the role that data and digital plays in the future fundraising landscape, most still need to rethink their current digital strategy. Because it is those charities that embrace digital transformation as an enabler of change – boosting productivity, opening new channels for engagement, improving agility and increasing fundraising – that will prosper and thrive.</p>
