<p>Property tech, or what is now known as proptech is a sector that has grown in leaps and bounds in the past few years amongst app developers. With several startups based in the UK, many are choosing to use various forms of tech to transform the property market into a more modern approach. From renting to investments, selling and buying, proptech startups aim to make what is normally a very stressful process into one that is simple through app development.</p>
<p><strong>Here are our top picks of proptech startups to watch:</strong></p>
<h1>1. AskPorter</h1>
<p><a href="https://askporter.com/">AskPorter</a> makes us of AI to provide estate agents with smart virtual assistants, landlords and property managers to automate tasks such as chasing rent or arranging a contractor. AskPorter claims that the process of onboarding with them is as simple as providing an email address and telephone number and everything works with AI thereafter. The company have raised £1.5 million in their seed round in August this year from investors including Pi Labs, Venture University, Plug and Play, Henley Investments and WISAG FM.</p>
<h1>2.  Landbay</h1>
<p><a href="https://landbay.co.uk/">Landbay</a> is a peer-to-peer app-based marketplace providing investors with access to borrowers and buy-to-let managers faster to access a mortgage. It was founded in 2014 by current CEO John Goodall and ex-Sequioa consultant Gray Stern. Landbay announced a funding of £1 billion had been agreed with a ‘leading financial institution’ to provide financial backing for its mortgages back in July. COO Julian cork stated that this investment would allow Landbay to reach a greater audience of buy-to-let landlords which would provide more growth and scope for the app developers and the business overall.</p>

<h1>3. Unmorgage</h1>
<p>London-based<a href="https://www.unmortgage.com/"> Unmortgage</a> provides the ability to reach homeownership gradually for people that are struggling to get a mortgage. A minimum of £12,500 is needed upfront, so a minimum of 5% of the total value of the property as well as an evaluation of your combined household income. The firm will provide the rest of the deposit through a third-party funding partner, such as a pension fund, which allows you to move in straight away and pay rent back to cover the cost of the mortgage and pay off the deposit gradually. Afterwards, you can overpay month-to-month to increase your ownership until you reach complete ownership. This proptech startup also promises to assist future homeowners to navigate themselves through the complex world of home ownership including assessment ventures and managing solicitors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile app development is not always smooth sailing.  There&#8217;s only so much you and your brand new Macbook Pro can do, and unless you are highly skilled in market research, mobile app design, code writing and QA, you may need a bit of help!</p>
<p>But trawling through google trying to find the perfect <a href="http://borneagency.com/">mobile app development company</a> can be time-consuming and, let&#8217;s face it, a tad boring. Perhaps there&#8217;s the temptation to throw in the towel and abandon your idea altogether. But if you&#8217;ve got something good, it&#8217;s worth sticking with. We&#8217;ve seen entrepreneurs go from zero to hero, and it looks fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Mobile App Agency or Freelancers?</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to freelancers, app development agencies bring a depth of multi-disciplinary experience to your project. The combination of specialism and size may ensure the company is in a better position to deliver a larger scale project, however if it&#8217;s something simple like a logo design, hiring a freelancer could be more cost effective.</p>
<p>Our team have put together a failsafe guide to hiring a mobile app development company. Regardless of the size of your project, these top tips will help you to hire the right team for you, ensuring your product gets the best possible start in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1: Ask Around</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of our own clients come to us via referrals. Start ups often overlook the size of their network, and there is no better way to find the right app development company for you than through word of mouth.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the world of tech by attending some start up events &#8211; for those of you who are London based <a href="http://www.tech.london/events">Tech.London</a> is a great place to start. Network with other entrepreneurs and discuss their experiences have been with different companies. Even if they don&#8217;t have experience with mobile app developers specifically, they are bound to have some useful insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2: Show Them You Mean Business</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do you have to make sure that the app developers are the right people to take on your project, you also have to be a good fit for them. At Borne, we only take on projects which we can see the client is passionate about, and only if they have a well thought out plan for the future. We encourage our clients to think of us as partners and work with us on a one-to-one basis. Let&#8217;s just say, if we met our clients at the pub on a Friday night, it wouldn&#8217;t be awkward.</p>
<p>So, we recommend spending some time preparing for your initial meeting with answers to any questions you think that you might be asked. Bring with you a list of apps you enjoy using with the reasons why in order to help the team get a sense of what you are like, as well as designs you love. We tend to know what apps we enjoy using, but working out <em>why </em>is a different matter. Is it the ease of use? The colour scheme? It&#8217;s worth putting some thought into these in order to make the kick off meeting as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p>Arrive at the meeting with a clear description of what your app is going to be, how it will benefit the user, and a list of features the app must have. Arriving prepared allows the design and development team to see that you have actually taken time to think through your idea.</p>
<p>If the developers can see you are serious, they are far more likely to take on your project. Take the time to go through everything with your potential development team, ensure no stone is left unturned and the development process will run a lot more smoothly.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 3: Look At Their Previous Work</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you should never sign an app development contract without seeing examples of the work they have already produced.  You wouldn&#8217;t invest money in a house you haven&#8217;t seen, and with app development, the stakes are far higher (or maybe it&#8217;s only us who think that).</p>
<p>A good mobile app development company should have excellent UI/UX skills, but don&#8217;t just take their word for it. It&#8217;s worth downloading some of their apps to see how they actually work, as opposed to just nodding along to a selection of screenshots.</p>
<p>The apps should have great designs with excellent user interfaces. Pay attention to the small features, such as how neatly text fits into boxes and whether the buttons line up. Is the app easy to use? The tone consistent? It&#8217;s all in the detail. Little inconsistencies can ruin the whole feel of your app.</p>
<p>If possible, check client references. Look for app developers who can give you details of their previous clients. Ask these clients about the company&#8217;s ability to work to a deadline, overall value for money, general feedback and their willingness to recommend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 4: Cover All Bases</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never sign anything until you know exactly what services you will be paying for. Some app development companies will only develop, others will only design and some will do it all, from brand identity to QA testing.</p>
<p>Most clients find they want the same development company working on all aspects of the project. It ensures the team really get to know the brand, the design and the target market and would be in a better position to offer help with <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-post-app-launch-priorities/">post-launch marketing</a> if required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>Tip 5: Be Specific</u></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of being specific cannot be overemphasised. Without a clear understanding of the direction you want to take your project, there is very little your mobile app developers can do.</p>
<p>A good development company will listen intently to your project pitch, take notes and ask insightful questions, even bringing up potential problems your project may face before they arise.</p>
<p>When presented with a business requirement document, ensure you go through it thoroughly, line by line, before signing anything. This is no iTunes terms and conditions, a BRD is serious stuff and deserves your time. The more specific you are at the initial stages the better, as it means less changes will have to be made (which will cost you time and money) further down the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Be Realistic </span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App development doesn&#8217;t come cheap. It&#8217;s a huge investment which is why it&#8217;s so important to ensure you choose the right company. It is important however, not to be driven solely by price. Selecting a mobile app development company because they offer you the best price is not a good idea, and you may find that they cut corners further down the line.</p>
<p>While budgeting is highly important, cheaper options can end up costing more in the future. Don&#8217;t get ripped off, but don&#8217;t be a cheapskate either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Consider A Local Agency</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not completely necessary, choosing a development company local to you can make designing and developing your project a hell of a lot easier. We regularly have clients come in to see us, sometimes to talk about the app, sometimes just for a decent cup of coffee and a chat about how our day is going.</p>
<p>All to often, feedback and comments can get lost in a stream of emails, making everyone&#8217;s lives more difficult. Plus, you can never really determine anyone&#8217;s true feelings via email, and there&#8217;s always a chance that something will get misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 7: Listen To Feedback</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your developers are friends, not foes. In an ideal world, the development team should give you feedback wherever possible, and it&#8217;s important that even if you don&#8217;t agree, you still take what they say onboard. Although you may disagree on certain aspects of the project and they will do their best to accommodate your preferences, remember that if you&#8217;ve hired the right app developers, they will have experience in creating <em>successful</em> apps. They will know the current trends in the App Store, the sorts of design that works and most fitting colour scheme for your brand. In fact, if your mobile app developers are quiet and repeatedly accommodating throughout your project, that&#8217;s when you should worry. No one&#8217;s idea is <em>that </em>good.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on giving constructive feedback to our clients, guiding them wherever possible into making the best decisions for their project. If you have a large team of app developers, ensure they give feedback on your idea and listen to what they have to say. Actually listen.</p>
<p>Chances are, they know better than anyone what works best and will want your app to succeed as much as you do.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 8: Have A Post-Launch Plan</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood, sweat and tears have paid off and now hooray, the app is finished! Although&#8230;it&#8217;s not finished.  It&#8217;s far from finished.</p>
<p>Your app is never actually &#8216;finished&#8217; and ensure your developers know this. There is always more to be done, whether it&#8217;s fixing bugs, developing new features for users or starting work on version two.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss maintenance and updates at the beginning of the process. Then, once the app is signed off and launched, get to work on making it even better. Having a maintenance plan in place at the start of the project means no one is caught off guard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-20-at-16.23.54.png" alt="mobile app developers " width="719" height="561" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1143" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerFront-1024x723.png" alt="mobile app developers" width="840" height="593" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1142" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerBack-1024x723.png" alt="street food london" width="840" height="593" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Finished Product</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to part 3 of our app launch series, helping you gain exposure for your app and increase downloads.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, getting the name of your app out there has become harder than getting a seat on the Northern Line in rush hour. To put it simply, there are too many people trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>When the App and Play Stores are dominated by the likes of Tinder, Candy Crush and Instagram, it can be hard to find your feet. But it’s important to remember that even the top downloaded apps started out as mere ideas too. With some clever marketing, nifty tricks and a quick look at the tactics of those who have absolutely smashed it, you will be able to gain exposure for your app before it’s even launched.</p>
<p><u>Be Different</u></p>
<p>From collaborating with an unexpected brand to running a marathon dressed in an iPhone outfit (kudos to RunKeeper for this!) there’s a number of ways that you can gain exposure for your app in ways that could excite, confuse or intrigue your potential users.</p>
<p>For an example of this we will look to the horribly addictive Angry Birds. In 2011, Angry Birds set up a real life game in the middle of Barcelona. Locals and tourists used smartphones to control a real life slingshot while a live band played the music featured in the game.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not possible to do something as huge as this when just starting out, but by doing something a bit different, Angry Birds landed media coverage on hundreds of blogs and videos of the life-size game were widely shared online. Anything that gets potential users talking, sharing or hash-tagging is a win when it comes to marketing your app.</p>
<p><u>Create A Teaser Video</u></p>
<p>Teaser videos started as a nice touch but have now become something of an essential.</p>
<p>A bit like a movie trailer, you can be as creative or as wacky as you like. But remember, sometimes simplicity wins (everyone remember Flappy Bird?). Having a video showing either a demo of the game or a sneak peek will make users excited. Humans are predominantly visual and love to be shown something as opposed to simply told about it.</p>
<p>Although you may have to put some money aside for creating and promoting the video, if it manages to spark interest and increase engagement, it’ll be worth it.</p>
<p><u>Appeal To What People Love</u></p>
<p>Just a quick glance at Facebook and Twitter trends and you can get a pretty good idea of what people are loving when it comes to social media.</p>
<p>A company who did a great job of appealing to the masses was Uber, who took advantage of National Cat Day. The company’s campaign UberKITTENS was used to promote adopting animals from shelters as opposed to breeders. On National Cat Day, users in a number of US and Canadian cities were able to hail an UberKITTEN to their office, with 15 minutes of cuddle and playtime with a kitten costing $30.</p>
<p>Uber nailed this campaign for so many reasons, many of which we can learn from. They worked alongside something people love, and that is, cat videos. We are all guilty of logging onto Facebook with the intention of replying to a message and being lured into a four-hour cat video binge. Uber knew this, and they played up to it.</p>
<p>National Cat Day is the day that users are posting about cats, tweeting about cats and thinking about cats. What better way to gain exposure for your company than actually giving people real life cats to play with, photos of which they will no doubt share on social media? Hats off to UberKITTENS, they absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Two takeaways from this hugely successful campaign? Do your research and make sure your timing is impeccable. UberKITTENS would have worked almost any day of the year because, let’s face it, it’s adorable. But the fact that it was National Cat Day just heightened the campaign’s success. There is no point launching a fitness app two weeks before Christmas! New Year’s Day on the other hand couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate &#8211; just make sure you follow our app launch series to help you beat the competition!</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing your app there is no better advice than have fun, get creative and be different. The users will come running. Check back in next week for the next part of our app launch series!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to part 2 of our app launch series, containing all our little tips and tricks to make sure your app launch is a success! Last time, we looked at <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-1-app-store-optimisation/">app store optimisation</a> and the reason it is so important, alongside some nifty tricks to make your app stand out from the rest.</p>
<p>This week, we are moving onto the use of Instagram when it comes to promoting your app. The social platform which began as somewhere that millennials could post pictures of their avocado toast has now become a vital ingredient in your mixing pot of marketing techniques &#8211; although the avocado toast days are far from over.</p>
<p>Instagram is a reliable and effective business tool. Whether it&#8217;s a start up looking to market their latest digital product or an already established brand reaching out to their loyal customers, Instagram can do wonders for your business.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our top tips for using your Instagram page to connect with users, drive downloads and increase website traffic.</p>
<p><u>Tone Of Voice</u></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8217;ll say it again, consistency is key. If your app development company are also doing your branding for you then the tone of voice will be something that crops up time and time again. However, Instagram is a different sort of platform and, in our experience, the kind of copy that you may use on platforms like LinkedIn may not go down quite as well on Instagram.</p>
<p>If your app or product is generally fun, playful and entertaining, then there&#8217;s no need to change what you&#8217;re doing. Make sure your Instagram description and bio mirror this.</p>
<p>If the nature of your product is more formal, serious or professional however, then we recommend taking this opportunity to show off a more personal side to your business. Instagram works best when it is used to showcase the personalities behind your brand or a sneak-peak into the day-to-day life of your product and employees; allowing your users to feel that they can connect with you personally. Adapt your voice to suit the tone of the platform, personal, light-hearted and relaxed.</p>
<p><u>Hashtags</u></p>
<p>Hashtags can do wonders for the engagement on your pictures, as without them there&#8217;s very little to actually help users discover you! Your hashtags will allow potential users to stumble across pages which they otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have seen. However, like all good things, there is always the temptation to overdo it.</p>
<p>The hashtags you use on Instagram need to be relevant to your app. While it may get you a few more followers or likes to continually hashtag your posts with #followforfollow or #likeforlike, it&#8217;s not going to attract the right sort of people &#8211; aka potential users. Plus, for anyone who is genuinely interested in your app, an excess of irrelevant hashtags can look spammy and cheap which may put them off exploring your Instagram or product further.</p>
<p>Using relevant hashtags that will appeal to people who are looking for a product just like yours is the best way to effectively utilise them. Pay attention to other hashtags that are being used on similar products to yours, as this will help you appeal to the right people and stay on top of the competition.</p>
<p><u>Captions</u></p>
<p>Instagram will cut off your caption after 3-4 lines of text, so it is best to chuck the important stuff at your users before they have to click &#8216;more&#8217;. Pop the hashtags, mentions and any extra information at the end of your captions, they are there to help users discover your page and, unless your hashtags are used humorously, won&#8217;t add anything extra for people who have already discovered your images.</p>
<p>The four lines the user can see should be enticing, engaging and make them want to read more. And remember, if the link to your product is in your bio, you should tell your followers! &#8216;Link in bio&#8217; is all that&#8217;s needed at the end of your caption, that way your users know where to go to get the product you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Including a call to action is another great technique when it comes to writing your captions. If you have a large following it can be a great way to get people to engage with your photos, but it&#8217;s worth doing even if you&#8217;re just starting out.</p>
<p>Examples of using calls to actions to increase engagement are, &#8216;share your story in the comments&#8217;, &#8216;double tap if you agree&#8217; or, &#8216;we&#8217;d love to know what you think&#8217;. Instagram also now allows users to &#8216;like&#8217; and reply to comments, so you can even engage with user’s reactions to your images. Remember, Instagram is personal. It&#8217;s rarely about the hard-sell and instead should be used as a way to engage with your users, explore other pages and showcase your creativity.</p>
<p><u>Bio</u></p>
<p>Currently, Instagram does not allow users to post links in their descriptions which, to be honest, is one of the things we love about it. It may not be as effective for startups and brands trying to promote their website, product or app, but for now we&#8217;re just going to have to work with what we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Of course, you should include your main link in your bio. Alongside a short description of what your product actually is, we recommend a call to action, encouraging any potential users or followers to get cracking with the download. Users should feel like they <em>need </em>your app, that it is the answer they&#8217;ve been looking for or that it will fill a gaping void in their lives. If you are struggling to make your app sound like a necessary, engaging or useful product then, well, why did you bother developing it?</p>
<p>Users need to be convinced in those few lines that you will add something substantial to their Instagram feeds. But remember that Instagram is a community in which you should connect with your followers on a personal level. Your bio should pop with a bit of personality. No one likes a bore on Instagram, that&#8217;s what LinkedIn is for.</p>
<p><u>The Actual Images</u></p>
<p>We can talk about hashtags, descriptions and captions until the cows come home, but at the end of the day, Instagram is a predominantly visual platform. Spending hours putting together an engaging description explaining why followers should download your app is all very well, but if the image accompanying this creative masterpiece is low quality or irrelevant, you&#8217;re not going to get very far.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is essential that you spend some time working on the images posted in your Instagram feed. Not only do the pictures have to relevant to your product, eye catching and high quality, it is worth noting how the images fit together on your &#8216;grid&#8217;. You can easily use your camera role to put a collection of photos together and see how they look. Although it&#8217;s not essential, we recommend sticking to a similar &#8216;theme&#8217; throughout your feed. This ensures that, collectively, your feed is aesthetically pleasing and showcases something that is of a high quality. Consistency in colour schemes and themes will attract followers and hopefully drive visits to your website or further downloads.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for part 2 of our app launch series, check back in next week for more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest challenges now faced by mobile app developers and their clients is getting potential users to actually download the app. If the app is a good quality, you should have no problem retaining your initial users, but there really is no point spending large amounts of money on branding, app design or development if you are unable to reach your target users.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we’re going to be putting together a series of posts on how to make your app visible to users and actually get them downloading your product. From today’s app store optimisation (ASO), social media strategies and how to secure yourself a guest blog post, we’ll be with you every step of the way to make sure your app gets the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>For tips when it comes to launching your app, check out one of our previous posts – <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/heres-why-launching-an-app-is-a-lot-like-speed-dating/">why you should treat your app launch like a first date</a>. It sounds bizarre but, trust us, this analogy works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Why is App Store Optimisation So Important?</u></strong></p>
<p>App store optimisation is the process of optimising mobile apps so that they rank higher on the app store’s search results. ASO will make your app visible to more people, therefore receiving more downloads. Optimising their app is something our clients so often neglect or ignore when they begin the process of mobile app development, occasionally leaving their apps to gather cobwebs, rendering all their (and our!) hard work on the development side completely useless.</p>
<p>According to research by Forrester, 63% of apps are found through searches on the app stores. Clearly, it is the best way to discover new apps, and it is how the majority of users find apps to download. Social media campaigns, blogging and content marketing obviously have their place when it comes to reaching new users, but ASO simply cannot be neglected. Spend time working on your ASO or, if you are short of time there are plenty of app development companies who will offer this service. It really is your secret weapon, investing energy into it will pay off big time when it comes to outranking the competition and securing those downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Where Do I Start?</u></p>
<p>The good news? App store optimisation is marginally less complex than search engine optimisation (SEO), The bad news? Realistically you will have to put time and resources into both to really make your app stand out, but that’s a topic for another post. For now, let’s discuss the crucial components of ASO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>App Store Or Play Store? </u></p>
<p>What works for the App Store will not have the same impact on the Play Store, and this is something that is consistently ignored when it comes to optimising your app. Some of the key differences between them are; app title character limit, description character limit and the influence of keywords in the app’s description. It is important to adapt your ASO based on whether your app is launching on Android or iOS, as they each have very different requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Keywords</u></p>
<p>Just like search engine optimisation, keywords are the basis of all app store searches. Find a decent keyword research tool such as <a href="https://www.appannie.com/">App Annie</a> which will help you discover high traffic keywords as well as various app rankings. During your branding stages either you or your app development company should have compiled a list of your competitors. These research tools can be used to work out which keywords your competitors are using, and help you choose the best keywords to optimise, in order to get your apps ranking higher than your competitors.</p>
<p>Keywords need to be <em>continuously </em>monitored and changed. It is not enough to write one description and think you are done. Update them, change them and test out different words and phrases (or, if you can’t be bothered – we’ll do it for you!).</p>
<p>You’ve got together your list of keywords, but how do you use them? This is where you need to consider your app and play store research, as they both have different requirements and therefore different ways to optimise. For both stores, we recommend incorporating appropriate keywords where you can, but beware of keyword stuffing. A mixture of long and short tail keywords will ensure you’re not cramming your description with the same keyword over and over. Not only does this look cheap and spammy to potential users; it may incur penalties or result in your app being suspended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Title</u></p>
<p>Your title needs to be short, snappy and informative. It needs to be creative, unique and in line with your brand values. Something that intrigues, informs and excites. Oh, and you also need a keyword in there. Easy right?</p>
<p>Research has shown that apps with a keyword in their title have an average of 10.3% ranking increase so make sure it’s a good’un. Go for one with the highest search traffic.</p>
<p>It is generally self-sabotaging to change your title– imagine if Instagram suddenly renamed themselves – so the title is extremely important.  If you’re going to spend a large amount of time on <em>anything, </em>it should be your title. Don’t get lost in the crowded app store, make sure you stand out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Description</u></p>
<p>Both the App Store and Play Store have different requirements when it comes to the description of your app. If your app is launched on the App Store, your description does not impact search rankings, therefore you can optimise it for <em>potential users only.</em></p>
<p>However, on the Google Play Store, the app’s description <em>is</em> taken into account when ranking your app. For this reason, it should be written with both users and the search engine in mind! Of course, it goes without saying that you should incorporate keywords into your description but try to make them flow naturally. Don’t get caught in the trap of neglecting your users in your description. No one and I repeat, <em>no one </em>is going to download your app if they can’t work out what it does because you’ve used all your allocated characters keyword stuffing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remember</u></p>
<p>ASO is a long process, it will take time and it needs to be monitored constantly. However, many app developers do little to no work on ASO and neglect to inform their clients that their apps may not be immediately visible to users on launch day. Because of this, even spending a few days focusing on your app store optimisation means you will be well ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>This, alongside the different marketing tricks and tips we will focus in later blog post, will ensure your app is visible in the app and play stores, attracts your target user base and <em>actually gets downloaded</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that can really suck the soul out of an already miserable Monday, it&#8217;s an unproductive meeting. A bad meeting can leave clients and employees feeling drained and uninspired. In an industry as fast moving as mobile app development, every team or client meeting needs to motivate, encourage and inspire.</p>
<p>Our mobile app designers and developers have whittled their meeting strategy down to a tee. Not a moment longer than necessary is spent in those sometimes awe-inspiring, sometimes soul-destroying, glass windowed meeting rooms at Borne Digital HQ. Our team is here to share our strategies, tips and tricks, to ensure your company can come out of their client meetings feeling fresh faced and ready to tackle the day (and, more importantly &#8211; still liking each other).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our team&#8217;s top tips for making the most of your meetings:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know the purpose</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re big believers in writing down the purpose of our meeting before we even go in. Each morning, our app developers and designers hold a &#8216;scrum&#8217;, where we take it in turns to go through what we did the day before, and what we are planning to work on that day. The purpose is to make sure everyone is on the same page and we all know what everyone else is working on.</p>
<p>When it comes to client meetings, we will always clarify the purpose of the meeting beforehand. This ensures that no stone is left unturned and that all necessary questions can be asked. It also means we don&#8217;t go off track and start arguing about which overpriced London chain does the best Christmas sandwich (FYI, it&#8217;s Pret).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be visual</span></p>
<p>Working in a creative industry means we need to do everything we can to make sure our team members come into work each day ready to design some beautiful products. We love using the walls and windows to add a little extra creativity to our meetings.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a branding meeting with a client, our team will spend some time beforehand preparing visuals to stick up on the wall. These may be pictures of various cars or celebrities which can be used to determine target user base, colourful mind maps or competitor logos and colour schemes. We love getting creative and it ensures our meetings are a bit more exciting than just sitting and talking after (or occasionally over) each other.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If all else fails, sweets</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like some unidentifiable E-numbers to get our creative juices flowing. We recommend this for afternoon meetings only, that way your team will be safe at home with a cup of tea when the dreaded sugar comedown begins.</p>
<p>When we know our meetings are long ones, we make sure we have a supply of sweets or chocolate to give us all an extra boost. If the team members actually want to be there, you will get a lot more out of them, and if the only way to manage that is through bribery then so be it!</p>
<p>For meetings with clients we also provide snacks. Branding, marketing and tech talk can be exhausting so allow your clients to ingest their weekly sugar allowance in one sitting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May it was revealed that nearly a quarter of people abandon an app after just one use. Launching an app that provides a positive experience for the user has never been more important, and it is essential that your mobile app developers draw on all available resources to make that initial contact as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>A user’s first interaction with your app is a lot like speed dating. You have approximately 2 minutes to make a good impression, to show off all your best qualities, and to avoid saying anything inappropriate.</p>
<p>Your mobile app developers are your matchmakers. Follow our advice and we’re confident your app and user will get off to a cracking start.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-boarding experience</span></p>
<p>If there is ever a time to make a good impression, this is it. If your date says something awkward or inappropriate, or the meeting just isn’t as smooth as you’d anticipated, recovery is difficult. There is, of course, still a chance for your app to make up for it, but, like an awkward first date, it will need to <em>really </em>excel in other areas to stop the classic ‘emergency phone call’ we are all guilty of inventing.</p>
<p>On-boarding doesn’t have to be hugely complicated. In fact, sometimes it’s best if you and your app developers keep it simple. A few basic (but aesthetically pleasing) screens highlighting what the app does and how to use it is enough.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to provide users with a ‘skip’ button because there are still people in the world who refuse to read the instructions and these are the people whose IKEA furniture ends up looking like this…</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ikea11.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-491 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ikea11-1024x681.jpg" alt="mobile app developers" width="1024" height="681" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy</span></p>
<p>Privacy concerns are becoming more and more prevalent when it comes to technology, and users will no longer sit back, oblivious to what happens to their data as we did in the good old Bebo days.</p>
<p>Apps which automatically post to social media accounts (embarrassing), pass on data to third parties or track geolocation without permission are a big no no. Ensure your app only asks for geolocation permission if and when it needs it<em>. </em>If your app cannot function without geolocation tracking that’s fine, but make sure the user knows this.</p>
<p>Again, think of this as like a first date. It’s all going well and then BAM, your date asks for your address and social media handles. Oh, and they also plant a tracker on your body.It’s weird, it’s inappropriate, and someone will probably end up getting hurt.</p>
<p>Ensure all privacy policies are clear, visible and easy to understand, and clearly state when signing in via social media that this does <em>not </em>allow the app to post to the user’s social media accounts without permission. Essentially, be clear about why your app needs the users’ data, and if the app doesn’t need it, don’t ask for it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cluttered with ads</span></p>
<p>Don’t prioritise short-term cash through ad revenue in favour of user loyalty.</p>
<p>Banner ads often block the content of the app which will raise the average user’s frustration levels to a solid 11 out of 10, especially if the close button is difficult to find. The ads detract from the whole app experience, are infuriating and more often than not, have absolutely nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>Forcing users to pay for the premium version of the app in order to remove adverts will do little for your user loyalty. You would never date someone solely for their money (well, we hope you wouldn’t), and users don’t like to feel that you are taking advantage of them and their spare 75p.</p>
<p>Alternatives to bombarding users with costly options to remove ads are to find a constructive way to offer in-app purchases that genuinely enhance the experience. Alternatively, present adverts in the way Facebook or Instagram does, non-intrusive and displayed in a way that doesn’t force the user to interact with, or even look at them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical flaws and bugs</span></p>
<p>As mobile app developers, we know how frustrating it can be when an app has a technical flaw or bugs, but if there’s one thing we want our clients to know, it’s that it’s <em>impossible </em>to completely eliminate them. So try not to get upset with your developers when Apple updates their software and suddenly your app doesn’t run properly.</p>
<p>Whilst techie glitches do occasionally occur, it is important to make sure that for the initial launch everything is running as smoothly as possible. If your date was constantly sneezing or coughing you would probably call it off fairly early, well, it’s the same with your app. Your app developers need to ensure your app is bug free, runs smoothly and doesn’t sneeze on anyone.</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth launch of a product we recommend that you put in place two safe guards, one a rigorous quality assurance process where expected outcomes are tested against actual outcomes. For example, if the specification says a user should be able to post a photo, add a comment and then later edit it &#8211; you should test this exact process with your beta version whilst documenting any bugs or graphical elements that are not the expected result.</p>
<p>Secondly we recommend doing a limited initial release, think friends and family, friends of friends &#8211; just enough to stress the platform into revealing any underlying bugs that were not discovered during the QA process. This pre-launch-launch ensures that you don’t release a platform to the wider public only to discover the backend has a mental breakdown when your app reaches 1000 users.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fishing for compliments</span></p>
<p>Make sure your app isn’t too needy. Constantly asking for ratings or reviews is only going to annoy your user, in the same way adverts will. Forcing them to rate your app whilst they are in the middle of using it is a sure fire way to get your app thrown away like yesterday’s leftover lunch.</p>
<p>Instead of breaking their flow, ask them to rate your app when they have actually achieved something and are feeling positive, not in the middle of the activity. Make sure you provide a ‘Do not ask me again’ option and ensure it&#8217;s easy for the user to rate. Remember, we are all lazy.</p>
<p>The way we usually set it up is to have a prompt asking, “Have you been enjoying using X so far?”. If the user says yes, ask “do you mind giving us a rating on the App Store?” with an option for either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;Don’t remind me again&#8221;. If the user clicks yes, the App Store will launch. If the user replies they do not enjoy using the app (although if they’ve been using it for this long, they probably just want to get rid of the prompt), simply say &#8220;Thanks for your feedback&#8221;. Job done, with no fishes in sight.</p>
<p><u>Where did it all go wrong?</u></p>
<p>Alas, sometimes your user and your app just don&#8217;t click, But there are still options for you. App analytics can be used to track page views and app events such as button clicks. It can be used to ascertain which features work or don&#8217;t work, as well as seeing which part of the sign up users might be dropping off at. Once the problem parts of the app have been identified, for example a specific on-boarding screen, your app developers can run A/B tests to see if improving that specific screen leads to an increase in engagement and less drop offs.</p>
<p>Like a first date, that initial contact can make or break the relationship between app and user, so it&#8217;s important to get it right. But remember, there are always improvements that can be made, no matter what the initial user response. Even the apps that dominate the App Store release updates and new features on a regular basis. And if, at the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t work out with some users, there&#8217;s plenty more fish in the sea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The working day used to be very different. Heaving ourselves out of bed after pressing snooze for the fifteenth time, eyes swollen shut with exhaustion before rushing to Starbucks to grab a coffee and chocolate pastry, reaching the office to tackle the mountain of emails which have accumulated between midnight (when we finally put our phones down) and 8am. And this was the least stressful part of our day. Scoffing lunch at our desks, or worse, forgetting to have lunch, juggling 3 different meetings with phone calls, emails and general everyday tasks, all the while inhaling enough coffee to bring a small animal back from the dead.</p>
<p>Being permanently high on caffeine and frantically replying to all your emails over the course of a 24-hour working day used to be the road to productivity and career success. Raised eyebrows were directed at anyone who actually left work on time and even our commute was an opportunity to dive head-first into our ever growing to do lists.</p>
<p>Yet now large tech companies are beginning to see the unpleasant effects of the ‘work-hard-do-nothing-else’ company culture that was so prevalent. They’ve realised that yes, we may get a lot done, but the high-stress environment effects employees both physically and mentally. More sick days, less employment satisfaction and strained relationships with colleagues were just a few of the side effects that coincide with such a high-pressure atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now, a new method of increasing productivity is emerging, office meditations. It’s based on the notion that a happy employee is a productive employee and, I speak from experience when I say that surviving on caffeine and 4pm Snickers bars is no road to happiness.</p>
<p>Tech giant Google began recognizing the benefits of meditation for employees back in 2011 after a Zen monk visited their Silicon Valley headquarters. The internal course, named <a href="https://siyli.org/">Search Inside Yourself,</a> was designed to help employees manage stress and emotions. <span class="s1">Greater happiness equals greater productivity which leads to company growth and yes, increased profit. Google also introduced ‘mindful lunches’ where the only noise during the meal is that of prayer bell, a far cry from swallowing our Pret chicken wrap whole whilst frantically stabbing at our keyboards with one hand. </span></p>
<p>As usual, Google are onto it. More than 1000 employees have completed their Search Inside Yourself training, Meditation and mindfulness have officially replaced caffeine. They have become the new fuel, with quiet contemplation the key to a successful day, and other tech giants have got in on the action. Steve Jobs reportedly allowed employees 30 minutes breaks in the official meditation room and he also provided on-site yoga. Many believe Jobs’ love for meditation actually helped him become so successful.  HBO has also implemented free yoga classes and meditation sessions into their working days. Device free rooms are opening in offices, and in France, some companies are banning employees from checking or sending emails ‘out of hours’, normally weekends or evenings.</p>
<p>But not everyone has jumped on the meditation bandwagon and, as with any new ‘trend’, there are sceptics. Some believe integrating Buddhist values into our high-pressure, high-speed lifestyles is counterproductive. As Buddhism is traditionally about renouncing material possessions and feeling content with what you have, it seems backward to use it’s techniques in a workplace where employees have targets to meet and must constantly strive to achieve more.</p>
<p>Dan Nixon of the Bank of England recently argued that widespread mindfulness meditations could actually effect a growing economy thanks to the ‘less is more’ values that it promotes. It teaches contentment, the opposite to the common view that ‘economics is all about consumption’. Perhaps if everyone becomes content with what they have, businesses will cease to grow at the rate they have been.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet taking time to focus on the present or setting aside a moment to relax during our working day doesn’t equate to Buddhism. Whilst the effect employee meditation may have on company growth counters the anti-material Buddhist teachings, the effects of mindfulness meditations on general well-being cannot be denied. Besides, anything is better than that 3pm coffee crash. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been keeping on top of the news this weekend then you won’t have missed the phenomenon currently dominating the digital world – Pokémon GO (if you have missed it then you can read our tech news round up <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/5-things-you-should-know-about-this-week/">here</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The augmented reality game, launched last Wednesday in Australia and the U.S, has already increased the value of Nintendo by $7.5 billion and the market capitalisation now stands at around $28 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just two days after the launch, the game was installed on 5.16% of Android devises, a huge amount, especially when compared to leading dating app Tinder, installed on 2%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps even more impressive, Pokémon GO looks set to beat Twitter’s daily active users. Last Friday, Pokémon GO had 3% of daily active Android users, not far from Twitter’s 3.5%, and it’s only going to keep growing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retaining the basics of past Pokémon games, Pokémon GO allows users to battle at Gyms, catch Pokémon and evolve your creatures. But, unlike past Pokémon games, Pokémon GO occurs in the real world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game superimposes Pokémon over your actual location using your smartphone camera. By physically walking around your area, the avatar moves along the map on your phone using GPS. Places with the most Pokémon are usually populated areas such as tourist spots or shopping centres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save players from walking into oncoming traffic with their eyes glued to their phone (although this has still happened), the phone will vibrate when a Pokémon is nearby and, once you spot it via your camera, you throw a Poké Ball to try to capture it. Players can collect other items, evolve their Pokémon and visit ‘Gyms’, where they join teams and battle with other players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why has Pokémon GO had such incredible initial success?  Or perhaps more importantly, what can start ups, marketers and<a href="http://borneagency.com/"> app developers </a>learn from this success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s delve a little deeper into what has made Pokémon GO so successful and what we, as marketers or app developers ourselves can learn from it’s launch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nostalgia Works</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing is clear from the launch of Pokémon GO, nostalgia works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why create something brand new when you can simply relaunch something so many people crave?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst appealing to the audience&#8217;s nostalgia may not be relevant for your specific business, there is still a lesson that can be learned from this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most notably, the concept of tuning into your customers’ emotions. One of the reasons why Pokémon GO has been so successful initially is because it ignites memories in millennials. Memories of collecting Pokémon cards at school, watching Ash and Pikachu in the anime series and memories of childhood adventure without the stresses of adulthood. Pokémon GO allows players to revisit old favourites with an extremely modern twist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As humans, we are naturally nostalgic. Companies have caught onto this and integrated nostalgia into their marketing campaigns. Mars Inc. revived Crispy M&amp;M’s with their ‘Crispy Is Back’ campaign, and Coca-Cola are the kings of nostalgic marketing with their current plastic bottles mirroring their old school glass ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bardofboston">Erik Devaney</a> writes extensively on <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/nostalgia-marketing#sm.0000028cma0zw7d77tfbjm39ytuxm">nostalgic marketing campaigns</a> and how companies can leverage the past in order to encourage consumers to buy. Essentially, if your content can make people feel nostalgic, a whole host of other effects will follow, including enhanced mood, increased self-esteem, social connectedness and feelings of positivity. Get people feeling like this and your chances of sales will skyrocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Fear Of Missing Out</u></p>

<p>Being successful at Pokémon GO requires more than just wandering around town hoping to spot some Pokémon. There’s only so many Pokémon that can be found in a specific area, meaning the app actually encourages users to get out and get exploring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fear of missing out is a key feature when it comes to Pokémon GO’s supposed addictiveness. People don’t want to miss out on certain Pokémon just because they don’t live in the right place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game encourages people to explore further afield than their hometown, to keep exploring and constantly search for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketers are regularly creating this sense of urgency with their campaigns. Special events and spot sales which occur only in a few regions spark a fear in people, that what they currently have is not enough and they have to reach further afield to achieve more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Igniting a fear of missing out has become a highly successful method of marketing. We assume people are enjoying life more than us. According to psychologists, irrational thoughts like these lead to irrational behaviours – such as impulse buying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson? Your marketing efforts should elicit feelings of exclusivity in your customers. Make your product feel exclusive and treat your current customers as though they’re part of a special club. Do this and you can be sure that others will go out of their way to join it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Limited </u><u>release</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less is more when it comes to marketing, and this is something which has worked brilliantly for Pokémon GO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game, currently only available in the U.S, Australia and New Zealand, has delayed it’s UK and international release date as the demand to play it is so high. The surge in people trying to play has actually broken the servers which power Pokémon GO, meaning the UK and international release has been ‘paused’, until the company is sure that it will work properly for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst we wouldn’t recommend deliberately attempting to break servers with marketing campaigns, chances are, having to wait a little longer for a product is only going to increase the hype surrounding it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anticipation is key when it comes to launching your product. Leave something for your customers to get excited about. If it’s an app that you are launching, this means not showing your whole hand straight away. Keep something extra up your sleeve for Version 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When marketing your product, give potential customers sneak peaks such as screenshots on social media or details about what you will provide. Excite your users with just a snippet of what you can offer and you will certainly see an increase in downloads or purchases when it comes to launch date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The New Gaming</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s so great about Pokémon GO and it’s immense initial success is that it encourages an entirely different form of gaming. We generally think of &#8216;gamers&#8217; as teenagers sat alone in dark rooms with their social skills depleting as rapidly as the zombies they’re shooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pokémon GO inspires something completely new and, ironically, it could be a game that helps America’s obesity epidemic. People are flocking to Twitter to share stories of sore legs and feet from running to catch their Pokémon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is exercising whilst gaming, something virtually unheard of until now. After all the research, it turns out it’s not the fear of diabetes that gets people off the sofa, it’s the knowledge that there may be a Pokémon just a short jog away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now gamers are getting outside and exploring. Yes, they may be searching for animated monsters via their mobile phones, but anything that gets such as huge number of people outdoors can only be a good thing. Although clearly there is a dark side to this new found liberation, as one unlucky girl <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36757858/pokemon-go-player-finds-dead-body-in-wyoming-river-while-searching-for-a-pokestop">stumbled across a dead body</a>, whilst robbers have used the app to lure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/10/pokemon-go-armed-robbers-dead-body">victims into remote locations.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of these unfortunate experiences, Nintendo has done something few have done before. They have created a product completely original, opening a whole new world that combines the digital with reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As app developers we are constantly encouraging people to figure out what they can do differently, how they can make their product stand out in the ever expanding app store. Use your imagination, take risks and do something different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy the game or not, I think we can all agree that Pokémon GO’s launch has been spot-on and their overwhelming success provides lessons we can all learn from.</p>
