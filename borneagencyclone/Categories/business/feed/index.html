				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to digital products, swiping right isn’t just about finding Ms or Mr Right in the dating world anymore. Employers are increasingly turning to recruitment apps to find the right candidate who will match a company’s specific criteria effectively. Recruitment apps can present current information about available candidates to recruitment agencies. Recruitment apps also open these positions to possible prospects. Therefore, these apps help employers and candidates connect. With the market of corporate recruitment software estimated to reach $1.5 billion, and 65% of candidates searching for employment opportunities on mobile devices, the future for digital transformation in the recruitment sector is a bright one.</p>
<p>When we are looking at the recruitment sector, digital transformation has been front and centre. According to a recent survey, 74% of businesses either have a digital strategy in place or are in the process of implementing one. Given the proven ability of digital tools to drive innovation and efficiency, this level of interest is hardly surprising. Nowadays, machine learning and intelligent automation are boosting productivity and optimising a vast range of back-office operations. Cloud-based platforms, mobile applications and data analytics are redefining the way businesses are engaging with their customers.</p>
<p>However, many businesses seem to be stalling on their journey towards digital disruption and a lack of talent and skill are fundamental obstacles. Among hiring executives that were surveyed who have put a digital strategy in place, 59% of these say they lack migration skills and integration, 64% cited a need for security expertise and 54% required more strategic digital transformation skills. Large enterprises have a more difficult time during the recruitment process than its smaller competitors, which is compounding marketplace disruption.</p>
<p><strong>New and Old Skills on Demand</strong></p>
<p>Talent requirements from various parties are extremely diverse. On one hand, businesses are faced with longstanding struggles to fill specific positions in Java and SAP, this tech is deeply embedded in the essentials of managing enterprise environments. At the same time however, over the past few years, the demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS), DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) and other cloud-based related approaches have increased significantly.</p>
<p>Also, businesses are focusing more on using automation and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to boost and enhance values that are strategic. This would create a need for skills around robotic process automation (RPA) deployment, as well as analytics and data science to leverage the capabilities of smart tools. There is a crossover when traditional skills as well as new talent reflects the broader picture that business may be facing today. While technical innovation is the primary goal, the reality is that modernising while maintaining existing operations remain essential priorities. The key in all of this is finding the optimal mix of skills – one that can integrate legacy systems with new tech to drive the transformational outcomes for tech.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2627 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1.jpg?_t=1589554109" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1.jpg 600w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Traditionally, managing the steps of traditional recruitment practices has been labour-intensive and time consuming task that absorbs a significant portion of talent acquisition professionals’ time and energy. Nowadays, RPA tools can execute many of the mundane administrative tasks associated with managing the recruitment journey – these include pipelining candidates, capturing specific data, transferring day from one application to another, processing documents, auto texting and scheduling video interviews etc.</p>
<p>More advanced cognitive applications apply natural language processing capabilities which enables instant messaging-activated chatbots. These digital products can handle routine communications between candidates and recruiters such as descriptions of new job openings, updates to the application and communications as well as gathering data on questions important to hiring managers. Also, these specific chatbots can provide insights and metrics on the type of candidates that are applying for the specific role and the gaps required to close any lack of suitable candidates. Like other industries and job functions, intelligent automation has allowed recruiters to spend less time on routine, repetitive work and more time focused on activities that hold more value. For example, rather than filling out paperwork or responding to basic questions, they can devote extra time to interacting with candidates. Contrary to the common perception that recruitment and the hiring process are being taken over by faceless robots, technology is helping to humanise the function, specifically by allowing recruiters to spend more time where it counts.</p>
<p><strong>Buying vs. Building</strong></p>
<p>Talent acquisition specialists looking to deploy tech to enhance the recruitment process have a variety of off-the-shelf options to choose from. Cloud-based HR solutions are becoming increasingly commonplace and HR processes like offboarding and onboarding are prime candidates for RPA initiatives. In many cases, tailoring the capabilities to specific requirements can be a viable option.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2628 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136.jpg?_t=1589554153" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136.jpg 600w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Given the dynamic job market and the ease of accessing CV’s, recruiters can easily identify candidates who, on paper, are qualified to fill a role. What is more of a challenge is gaining deeper insight into a candidate’s specific skills, as well as their potential alignment with a company’s culture. Emerging data analytics capabilities are playing an increasingly prominent role to address this challenge. Recruiters are deploying algorithms that apply various criteria to evaluate personality assessments that determine if a specific candidate is likely to be a good fit. Some are applying these algorithms to candidates’ social media footprints to dig deeper into the intersection between business culture and personality to assess the percentage of likelihood that a candidate may accept an offer that you make. Analytics tools like R Analytics, Python, SaaS and Power BI are allowing hiring managers and recruiters to gain deeper insights about national and international talent pools, projected candidate costs and whether to fulfil a role with a contractor or employee.</p>
<p>While recruitment apps have taken great strides recently, the winners in this sector will be an entrepreneur who devises a product to engage candidates that are passively engaging. Recruiting apps work amazingly for both employers and recruiters that are actively looking. However, a LinkedIn study discovered that 85% of people are passively interested in new opportunities. When an app comes along that can connect these candidates to the right jobs, this product would emerge as a winner. Talent searches will never slow down, however that doesn’t mean that the way in which we approach this will not change. Recruitment products are on the rise, and they are not going anywhere anytime soon. When it comes to building an app, swiping right on this progression may just give you that edge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a global spend set to reach $2 trillion in 2023 digital transformation has become more than just a buzz term that is banded around at every management get together. To me it is both a process and an outcome that provides both challenges and opportunities in equal measure.</p>
<p>Business leaders are all clambering around trying to align on their digital transformation strategies desperate to increase efficiencies across their business through digital and embrace technology better throughout their organisations.</p>
<p>We are fortunate enough at <a href="http://borneagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Borne</a> to see both sides as we work with disruptive start ups as well as enterprise clients so have insights into both the ‘disrupter’ and the ‘disrupted’ so to speak. 67% of business leaders think that their companies will no longer be competitive in 2020 if they do not address and adapt to change and become more digitized. But what does digital transformation actually mean for the larger business and how should they be looking at things?</p>
<p><strong>The corporate challenge</strong></p>
<p>I personally think that corporates should take a step back and look at the business much like a start up looks at their product when in the very early product ideation phase. Simply looking at a HR problem for instance and stating ‘we need to use AI to….’ is for me using tech for the sake of using tech. I think it’s important to evaluate what problem it is that the business needs to address. Be it a consumer or in house staff issue, you start with that problem. If the problem is retention then fine – perhaps look into an employee wellness or onboarding app, but don’t just ‘build an app’ for your employees without a clear goal of what problem it’s addressing.</p>
<p>It’s important to get into the mindsets of the employees within the organisation on a granular level in order to fully integrate them into whatever transformative process you are going through.</p>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGVK19xxHMgPQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1579132800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9G0myhIz1KrR73qlzZGN_jOXr3K_TIV8EiC3Bk4xglg" alt="No alt text provided for this image" width="1001" height="440" /></div>
<p>I think it’s necessary to look at how technology within an organisation can first improve the health and wellbeing of those within it rather than looking at how it will affect the bottom line. The theory being that if you get your internal transformative process correct the bottom line with take care of itself as a result. Of course there are transformation strategies that companies should look to adopt in order to better reach consumers and engage better but ultimately the consumer doesn’t care about the strategies, they care about the end product. I’ll write a bit more about this in a separate post.</p>
<p><strong>Employees First</strong></p>
<p>Getting employees on board and addressing concerns upfront will certainly alleviate concerns and increase buy in. Commons concerns such as:</p>
<p>&#8211;      Am I going to be replaced by a robot</p>
<p>&#8211;      Will I still have a job in 2 years</p>
<p>&#8211;      What if I don’t get on board with change?</p>
<p>&#8211;      Will this affect my day to day duties</p>
<p>These are all very common issues organisations will face and tackling these head on and at the start of any transformative process and having employees lead this process will make them feel part of it and also better shape the transformation. Consider it a User Experience gathering workshop for a new product, just with employees rather than end users.</p>
<p><strong>The end game</strong></p>
<p>So what does this mean for the corporates? To start with, it’s about embracing technology and using it’s efficiencies to best engage and support those within the organisation. Be it a technology ‘ally’ that offers support or services to employees such as food delivery or childcare to an in house CRM/HR platform that harnesses data fed to it from employees via an app that asks questions around general wellbeing and happiness at work. It’s all about support, enabling and having a growth mindset.</p>
<p><u>Creating a grassroots culture of digitisation is critical for change to not only be embraced, but for it to be successful.</u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2428 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-908284-1024x684.jpeg?_t=1566224154" alt="" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-908284-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-908284-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-908284-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-908284.jpeg 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Does the fixed-price model appear less risky to you because you know the total cost pf the project before your app has gone into development? If you delve a bit deeper, cracks will emerge in the fixed-price model as all product, scope of work and business decisions must be decided, contracted and declared before the project even begins. This would take place in a time where you know the least about your project.</p>
<h1>The Risks of the Fixed-Price Model</h1>
<p>The obvious source of mistrust that comes with the time and material model lies in that clients do not understand the software development process, how it is organised and the factors that are hidden that enhance its efficiency. At face value, choosing the lowest price and freezing expectations sounds like it helps save you money. However, it generates a lot of wasted resources, time, funds and energy. This includes:</p>
<p><strong>• Planning</strong></p>
<p>Once the scope is fixed, the only way forward in terms of working is the ‘waterfall’ working option. This means that the process of documentation and research is more important and it is because of this that planning could take the same time, if not longer than the development of the product itself. Unfortunately, if negotiations fall through after your first phase of development, this would be a great waste of your effort and time. In methods such as the time and material method. A quick initial estimate which is approved by you will allow for a smooth transition into development.</p>
<p><strong>• Time</strong></p>
<p>The time for learning the basics of your business and arranging the technical environment is challenging. When every function is filtered through, from quality assurance to design and development, this manner significantly reduces the chances of generating knowledge and the sharing of resources. So, the Fixed-Price model has a greater ramp-down and ramp-up phase.</p>
<p><strong>• Overhead Management</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the Fixed-Price model encourages an antagonist relationship rather than a partnership between your business and your developer/project manager. Instead of striving for a common goal, financial risk becomes the focus by you requesting a fixed price. This will result in the embedding of risk within the budget. To cope with this risk, processes will have to be supervised closely which would result in extra strain loaded onto project management. Agility will also be lost owing to every change being overly negotiated, analysed and the implementation of tight deadlines.</p>
<p>Here at Borne, we advocate for the time and materials model in which the price of your project is determined by an hourly rate or man-day rate so the accrual time spent on the project.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2429 size-large aligncenter" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1035588-1024x683.jpeg?_t=1566219964" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1035588-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1035588-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1035588-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1035588.jpeg 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h1>Why do we choose this model?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) The Time &amp; Material Model is Faster</strong></p>
<p>A detailed analysis of your project gives you the security and the details of the scope of the work before the project begins. This phase does take time; however, this practice shows that narrowing down all the features impossible. However, with the time and material model allows you to move at an accelerated pace whilst there are opportunities to work on finer details along the way. The fixed-price model takes longer to sign. This means less time spent on paperwork and more time on developing your project to its fullest potential.</p>
<p><strong>2) You Save Money</strong></p>
<p>Of course, this is a huge appeal, however it is not only the fact that you are saving money. You only pay for actual work completed while also saving time on the project. Also, the time and material model does not require additional overheads that some software houses offer through the fixed-price model as the fixed –price model requires higher premiums as there is less information provided.</p>
<p><strong>3) Final Product is Better When You Prioritise</strong></p>
<p>When an investor pays for every hour of work, they will analyse the Return On Investment (ROI) based on the features. We see this on a regular basis and it’s amazing! This cannot be done with the fixed-price model. This method assists in building things that are important for your product. Often, these things will not be the same as what was contracted in the beginning of development. Lastly, our priorities are aligned with your needs. Our team wants to deliver the highest quality possible and in the fixed-price model, software houses will tend to maximise the margins to reach the lowest possible cost during production.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2430 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1471752-1024x683.jpeg?_t=1566220092" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1471752.jpeg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1471752-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-1471752-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><strong>4) The Final Product is Better Because You Are Flexible</strong></p>
<p>Adjustments to the project requirements can be made in the time and materials model as well as shaping the project to your business circumstances which can be constantly changing. By doing this, there will be no need to conduct unnecessary discussions and renegotiations with us to determine whether the feature was in our remit. The time and management model allows for adjustments to the scope.</p>
<p>Let’s give a few examples:<br />
<strong>• Do you need to simply the process of registration? We can skip the unnecessary features for you. </strong><br />
<strong>• Want to grow your startup through an app? We can support you. </strong><br />
<strong>• Looking to increase your functionality? We can do it, no problem!</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) The Time and Material Model Lowers Your Risk</strong></p>
<p>You may not know the final cost of your final product; however, you have the freedom of not committing to a business relationship until the final stages of development. Additionally, transparency is absolute key in the time and material method which allows you to track where we are at any point in the development progress of your project. And of course, the overall finished product of a better quality significantly reduces risk to your business overall.</p>
<p>Unlike a car or house, software product development should be approached in a different way. While houses or cars have little room for improvisation through physical construction, code can be pivoted. That’s why, in our opinion, the best approach is to start but, however this does not mean that it must be slow. Start with an initial iteration, however you can make changes as you go along. The time and materials model gives you the flexibility to do this. We understand that this model requires trust so we encourage regular communication with our clients to ensure a streamlined and tailored product.</p>
