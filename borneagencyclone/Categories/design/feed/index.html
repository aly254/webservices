				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, product design or UX design is a crucial component in the making of mobile apps and websites. As you already know, design matters. As such, UX design helps to turn a simple idea into a beautiful, stunning and useful digital product. Thanks to UX design, users are able to return and use brands and their digital products over and over again.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you are a <a href="http://borneagency.com">mobile app developer</a>, program manager, product manager, project manager, marketing manager or a general user, it is important to understand UX design. In this article, we will focus on what is UX design, how UX design influences digital apps and product design. Also, we will touch on how UX designers can achieve user acquisition and retention.</p>
<p><strong>What is UX design?</strong></p>
<p>This is a creative and elaborate process where professionals identify a market opportunity, define the problem and create a solution for the problem(s). Also referred to as product design, it is the creation of digital products that enhance user experience.</p>
<p>The process involves the design of digital products such as mobile apps, includes aspects of design usability, functionality, and branding among others.</p>
<p><strong>Ways UX designers influence digital apps and product design</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Create digital solutions that support and enhance human interactions</em></p>
<p>UX designers contribute in numerous fields with one goal in mind, to enhance the experience of users as they interact with digital products. By doing this, they help to enhance growth and development among the people.</p>
<p>How are they able to achieve this? Working as a team, they create flows of layouts and interactions for health care, e-commerce, and education among others. These apps are applied in the fields above to offer tips, solutions, knowledge and technical support among others.</p>
<p>All of them help to influence how the final digital product will appear and function.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>Product research is a critical step in UX design. It allows the team to get feedback on what users are looking for. It also enables the team to learn what competitors have released in the market. Finally, it allows the team of designers to learn what aspects need to be improved in order to beat the competitors, attract users and retain them as well.</p>
<p>How should UX designers conduct research? Through user interviews, through online surveys, through competitive research, and through contextual inquiry. To ensure research is successful, plan your questions, find an experienced interviewer, keep it short and include both open-ended and closed-ended questions.</p>
<p>The team of designers and analysts should carry out meaningful research before settling on a certain design. As you already know, time spent during research is never wasted. It goes a long way in improving current and future products too. This helps the team save money, time and a lot of resources. As such, selling your ideas to other clients is easier. Here at Borne, we work with several UX tools that allow us to track user behaviour and consumer interactions that allow us to best design for the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>User analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data gathered from research needs to be analyzed in order to make sense. Through user analysis, the team is able to draw insights. Basically, they are able to capture, organize and make inferences about the users&#8217; needs which helps UX designers to come with the best digital products for the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to user analysis, the team identifies key user groups. Using this infor</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2385" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="291" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg 598w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 85vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>mation, they are able to create personas. These personas are fictional characters that help UX designers to figure out how users might use a digital product. Thanks to the creation of personas, UX designers understand the user&#8217;s goals. This is useful in ideation.</p>
<p>Designers should base the personas on real data. They should avoid using real names of people they know. Apart from personas, designers should create an empathy map, a tool that helps the team understand what users’ want and need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consider the why, what and how of product use</strong></p>
<p>Before embarking on a project, UX designers always consider the why, what and how of product use. The “Why” is all about product adoption by the masses. How they relate to tasks they want to perform and the views associated with the use of the product.</p>
<p>The “What” is all about functionality &#8211; things users will do with the final digital product. Will they use the digital product to learn, to gain knowledge, to collaborate, to entertain or manage everyday tasks?</p>
<p>Finally, we have the “How.” This encompasses the design of functionality. By this we mean, the designer should focus on how accessible and aesthetic the digital product will be.</p>
<p>In product design, UX designers always begin with the “Why” before embarking on the “What” and the “How.” By following this process, the team is able to create aesthetically pleasing and functioning digital solutions that offer meaningful experiences. Basically, the designers should ensure that the app, software, and website offers a fluid experience.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve actual problems</strong></p>
<p>There are tons of problems that digital solutions can solve. For instance, we need apps, websites, and blogs to disseminate information and news to the masses. To organize our daily schedules, we need to do list apps, calendar apps and note taking apps. When it comes to shopping for products, we need e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Finally, we have entertainment. Without apps and websites that enable us to stream, music, games, and videos, life would be dull.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. We need apps that allow us to do even simple things like keep time. To enhance usability and accessibility, UX design helps in the creation of aesthetic and intuitive interfaces and navigation. To achieve this, designers and mobile app designers spend hours building these products.</p>
<p><strong>Convert simple operations into intuitive and aesthetic pleasing to the human eye</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A lot of people imagine that UX design is all about dragging and dropping elements such as buttons, menus, color, and other elements. Yes, part of UX design is creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces for digital solutions. The other major part is largely about planning, research, analysis, and collaboration.</p>
<p>A vast majority of designers have been trained in internationally recognized institutions while others are self-taught. Thanks to the knowledge gained over a number of years, UX designers are proficient in combining beauty and functionality. And that is how they add value to digital solutions such as software, mobile apps, blogs, and websites.</p>
<p><strong>User Engagement and Retention in UX Design -How to Achieve It</strong></p>
<p>Upcoming designers always imagine that to attract and retain users on a mobile app, website, software or blog, the interface should be pretty. Well, that is not always the case. Take a website like Reddit. Even today when popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Material design feature on hundreds of blogs and websites, people still visit Reddit. Why? Simple layouts are still attractive.</p>
<p>So, what is the secret to user engagement in UX design? It is the experience itself. Users want to interact with an app or web platform on a simpler level. Yes, designers can incorporate colours, buttons, graphs, and menus but at the end of the day, what they want is to move from one page to the next with ease.</p>
<p>So, how can UX designers encourage user engagement? Here are a few techniques to achieve this</p>
<p><strong>Use of UX Animation</strong></p>
<p>Today, 2D animation plays a critical role in UX design. How? Diff<a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif"><img class="wp-image-2384 alignright" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif" alt="" width="369" height="277" /></a>erent animations can be created to elicit a particular behaviour. For instance, when a user hovers over a button, it can change colour say from red to green to show its clickable. Another example is error messages. They can pop up on a screen and shake. This helps to draw the attention of the user. So, to ensure user engagement, UX designers should create realistic animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simply the interface design</strong></p>
<p>As a UX designer, what you need to know is that users hate jumping through hoops when interacting with your mobile app, blog, software or website. People are interested in the final result. To achieve this, they need to use the quickest and simplest method. That means when designing, you should build UX flowcharts for every page especially when sketching wireframes. Imagine this, your website or mobile app requires users to sign up. If locating the sign-up page is difficult, they will opt to use other apps that offer a better experience. To simplify your digital products, start researching UX designs.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>
<p>The success of any digital product today and in the future will depend on better UX design. If you would like to find our more about how we employ design thinking and usability research into shaping our design decisions then <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact">get in touch. </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only one thing we love more than inspirational Steve Jobs quotes on Instagram, and that&#8217;s startups succeeding. From clients seeing their apps climbing up the App Store rankings, to the tech startups continually proving that there&#8217;s more to London than Big Ben and bad weather, success stories aren&#8217;t hard to to come by &#8211; especially in the capital.</p>
<p>Last year we wrote a post all about the <a href="https://borneagency.com/blogs/the-startups-doing-great-things-in-2017/">startups doing great things in 2017</a>, and it&#8217;s time for another dive into the tech world to see who&#8217;s flying high this summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2069" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Stasher</h2>
<p>Lugging heavy bags around London is our worst nightmare, especially in this heat. Paying to store luggage at train stations is well up there on our &#8216;things we don&#8217;t want to pay for&#8217; list, alongside car park tickets, extra storage on Dropbox and tomato ketchup sachets at McDonalds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stress of dragging a heavy bag around means options are somewhat limited, and Stasher lessens the pain of paying for storage by making storing your luggage easy, affordable and safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://stasher.com/">Stasher</a> is based on the AirBnB model. They work with hundreds of shops and hotels in cities all across Europe to provide somewhere for travellers to store their luggage. Customers book through the website, receive a confirmation email and can drop their luggage off. All storage points have a secure area for storing bags, and every piece of luggage is insured for up to £750.</p>
<p>Storing your luggage with Stasher costs £6 for 24 hours, and £5 for every additional day. This is less than half the price of storing your bag for a day at King&#8217;s Cross station. All &#8216;StashPoints&#8217; are a few minutes walk from the station, and all you need to bring is proof of your booking.</p>
<p>To say that Stasher are smashing it would be an understatement. The company has raised over $1 million and have StashPoints across London, Paris, Rome, Florence and many more cities in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2070" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Marshmallow</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marshmallow.com/">Marshmallow</a> want to lessen the financial difficulty that comes from moving to a new country.</p>
<p>Attempting to drive in the UK without a British driving license can feel like a never-ending series of hoops to jump through. Previous records mean absolutely nothing when it comes to car insurance, and Marshmallow are changing that.</p>
<p>Marshmallow is an insurance company that wants to make it easier for people to drive in the UK by accepting international licenses, as well as &#8216;no claims&#8217; bonuses from abroad. They have also ditched the fees, meaning those without a UK driving license will pay lower premiums, and can avoid being overcharged when they move to the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2068" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Tandem</h2>
<p>We love anything fintech, and <a href="https://tandem.co.uk/">Tandem</a> is our latest venture into a new form of banking. While we’ll never neglect our trusty Monzo cards, the Tandem card is a great addition to our wallets and provides something slightly different in the way of features.</p>
<p>Not only does Tandem allow you to manage <em>all </em>your bank accounts using just one single app, it also helps to reduce your bills by finding you better deals. Tandem also automatically shows you how much you spend each month and notifies you when your bills are due.</p>
<p>So far, it’s the easiest way that we have found to manage our money completely &#8211; and it also has no fees when you spend or withdraw cash abroad.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2071" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Pockit</h2>
<p>Another fintech startup (you may start to notice a theme developing here), <a href="https://www.pockit.com/">Pockit</a> wants to make bank accounts available to everyone, regardless of their income or credit status.</p>
<p>The company provides customers with an online account, a mobile app and Master Card. It’s open to all &#8211; meaning no credit checks, and users can sign up within minutes, receiving their card, account number and sort code. Money can be transferred to both UK and international bank accounts.</p>
<p>Pockit are also totally transparent about their fees, which is a welcome change in the banking world! The contactless Master Card costs 99p, as do bank transfers, ATM withdrawals and the monthly membership fee. The Pockit app is available on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pockit-online-current-account/id1022334791?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pockit.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_GB">Android</a>, is easy to navigate and well designed.</p>
<h2>Zego</h2>
<p>Last on the list we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.zego.com/">Zego</a>, who provide flexible insurance for self-employed workers. Zego provides insurance by the hour, which connects to work providers and only covers you when you are actually working.</p>
<p>With more and more people opting to work freelance for the flexible lifestyle it offers, insurance that mirrors this flexibility is well-needed. Zego&#8217;s first product was a pay-as-you-go scooter and car insurance for food delivery workers. Zego charges by the hour and drivers need only buy cover for when they are actually working.</p>
<p>For anyone self-employed thinking this sounds like a little too much to organise, Zego connects to the workplaces automatically. This means drivers don&#8217;t need to tell Zego when they are working. Instead, the cover starts once they log in for their shift.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immediately crushing any hopes and dream of a new iPhone, Tim Cook was quick to point out that Apple&#8217;s WWDC would be &#8216;all about software&#8217;. While we weren&#8217;t blown away by the software announcements last night, with many of them appearing to be a logical step up as opposed to something truly groundbreaking, the WWDC was still a good watch &#8211; we&#8217;ve got a lot to look forward to!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of yesterday&#8217;s WWDC.</p>
<h3>iOS 12</h3>
<p>First up is iOS 12 which, although lacking the &#8216;wow&#8217; factor of the iOS 10 or 11 announcements, is still a welcome update. The focus for iOS 12 is on speed and performance, and this new iOS will be supported by iPhones and iPads from as far back as 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Wellbeing</span></p>
<p>New features include a focus on digital wellbeing in the form of App Limits, which allows users to allocate times to use each app. App Limits will send users a warning when their time is running out, great for us Instagram addicts and Snapchatting teenagers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Memoji</span></p>
<p>On the subject of spending less time doing totally futile and irrelevant things on our iPhones, let us introduce Memoji, which we hate, but also kind of love.</p>
<p>Memoji allows you to turn yourself into an Emoji, putting a digital mask over your face in iMessage. You can add extra features like sunglasses and hats, and the face tracking technology will follow your movements so that your Memoji smiles, nods and speaks when you do. We don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ever going to use it, and we definitely think integrating it into FaceTime was a step too far &#8211; but it&#8217;s charming in a &#8216;brings back memories of The Sims&#8217; kind of way.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siri Shortcuts</span></p>
<p>Other improvements include a shortcut option for Siri in which simply saying a key phrase will take you to a certain app or feature. For example, &#8216;I&#8217;m heading home now&#8217; could open up your radio app and check the traffic, while &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a stressful day&#8217; might start a meditation. These shortcuts are also integrated into Apple Watch which we love.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group FaceTime</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve all been waiting for, group FaceTime.</p>
<p>Apple announced that we will soon be able to chat to up to 32 people at one time. While the UI is fairly impressive, we were all a little distracted as we frantically tried to work out how many friends we actually have (spoiler: not 32).</p>
<p>Once we recovered from our existential crisis, we were able to check out the UI which is looking good. Each member of the FaceTime chat has their own tile, which automatically expands while they are speaking.</p>
<p>We can certainly envision the app crashing with the tiles frantically enlarging and shrinking like an out of control firework display as more people try to make their voices heard, but let&#8217;s cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>
<h3>iOS Apps in Mac OS</h3>
<p>Apple has made the move to bridge the gap between Macs and iOS devices, and soon it will be easier to port iOS applications over to macOS. This is big news for app developers, who will receive the functionality sometime in 2019. The hope is that the desktop will become populated with native apps that look like their iOS counterparts. The first iOS apps available will include Stocks, News, Home and Voice Memos &#8211; so just the important ones then.</p>
<h3>WatchOS 5</h3>
<p>WatchOS 5 is getting the iOS 12 updates, which will make it more user friendly and intuitive when you want to talk to Siri. Instead of saying &#8216;Hey Siri&#8217; as you raise your wrist, users now need only raise their wrists and ask a question. Siri will recognise this interaction and reply.</p>
<p>The Podcast app is also being integrated into WatchOS 5 and notifications will be grouped, making the whole experience less overwhelming and distracting.</p>
<p>The best update to WatchOS 5? The walkie talkie mode. While we still long for the days of walkie talkies made out of plastic cups and string, chatting via WatchOS 5 is an alternative we&#8217;re willing to roll with.</p>
<h3>ARKit 2</h3>
<p>The second ARKit has a whole host of improvements. The big news is that there will now be multi-user support for augmented reality. This means that users can see the same AR objects from their devices at different angles, with LEGO demonstrating their virtual toys on stage.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new app Measure appears just like any other measure-via-AR app, but it&#8217;s got a few little extra quirks. The app will be able to automatically identify and measure objects, as well as allowing users to view the objects in actual size.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="e7bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s January, and we all know what that means. It’s time to dig out our now-too-small workout gear and join the hundreds of others with the same idea, angrily sweating their way through a workout in a gym that strongly resembles a tin of miserable, treadmill-pounding sardines. It’s goodbye morning bacon butties and hello kale, green juices or perhaps, if you’re really committed, veganuary.</h4>
<hr />
<p id="8348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’ll all be worth it when we get our dream body, we say to ourselves on January 2nd, miserably forking salad leaves into our mouths and trying not to think about the leftover Christmas chocolate at the back of the kitchen cupboard.</p>
<p id="3bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">New Year’s resolutions are notoriously hard to stick to, but with the mince pies, baileys and those seven large plates of turkey curry wolfed down between Boxing Day and January, ‘lose weight’ is the obvious choice of resolution for most people. But with 80% of New Year’s resolutions failing by the second week of February, it’s easy to think that achieving our weight loss goals simply isn’t on the cards for us.</p>
<h5>The Rise of Fitness Tech</h5>
<p id="b22e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Technology makes our lives easier in so many ways. We can order dinner via our smartphones. We can book a taxi, make a reservation, check the status of a flight. We can forget our wallets and know that it’s no biggie. We can pay off our debts and we can track our water intake. Hell, we can even check out our ex’s cousin’s housemate’s holiday album from his trip to Croatia back in 2011. And now? Now we can lose weight.</p>
<p id="30ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alright, so we still need to exercise and eat healthily. These are tech products, not plastic surgery coupons. But if you’re serious about your New Year’s diet, take your pick from our favourite fitness tech look set to hit the mainstream in 2018.</p>
<h5>Group Heart Rate Tracking</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" data-width="759" data-height="508" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" data-scroll="native"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" alt="mobile app developers uk" width="759" height="508" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" /></div>
</div>
<p id="c2ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Or, as we like to call it, The Spin Class from Hell</p>
<p id="c01c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, so we’re not really selling it, but we can certainly see the appeal. Gyms are now using technology to track members’ heart rates, calorie burn and training zones, displaying the results on a screen at the front of their fitness classes.</p>
<p id="1bfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does this mean for your weight loss efforts? Well, it means that everyone in your fitness class can see if you’re being lazy.</p>
<p id="0a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gone are the days when you could turn your spin bike back down to level 1 if you needed a little time out; it’s now clear as day who’s slacking.</p>
<p id="c89e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To us, this sounds like a living nightmare. But if you know you’ve got a competitive streak and want to see how you’re faring against other gym-goers, this could be the technology that brings out the best in you.</p>
<h5 id="bcd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual Reality &amp; Augmented Reality</h5>
<p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qymvSJkGeuu9awBallyzkA.png" alt="augmented reality app developers uk" width="800" height="446" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qymvSJkGeuu9awBallyzkA.png" /></p>
<p id="4967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Both virtual and augmented reality can play a part in helping you to shed some pounds this January. Remember the inspiring weight loss stories that sprung from Pokémon GO? No? Us neither. But we’re sure there were some.</p>
<p id="cacd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pokémon GO took the notion that you can’t exercise and game at the same time and turned it on its head. Gamers are no longer seen as lazy, pre-pubescents who spend all day in a dark room throwing insults at other gamers on the other side of the world. They’re more than happy to get outside in the fresh air if they have enough incentive.</p>
<p id="0946" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual reality in the fitness industry comes in many forms and is guaranteed to grow in 2018 (while hopefully helping us to shrink). Firstly, there’s the games. Two standouts for us are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://vr.fruitninja.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://vr.fruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/528550/Drunkn_Bar_Fight/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/528550/Drunkn_Bar_Fight/">Drunken Bar Fight</a>. While the name ‘Drunken Bar Fight’ doesn’t exactly scream ‘New Year, New Me’, its novel and unconventional way of encouraging exercise could just be what keeps us going.</p>
<p id="7cfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Fruit Ninja involves using virtual Samurai swords to chop up flying fruit, Drunken Bar Fight encourages users to punch and throw things, gaining strength as they drink more alcohol. It’s certainly unusual, but if it burns calories then we’re not complaining.</p>
<p id="73a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual reality is also being used in gyms to make running on the treadmill less boring. In 2015, Hong Kong gym <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.pure-fitness.com/hongkong/page/view/immersive_fitness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.pure-fitness.com/hongkong/page/view/immersive_fitness">Pure Fitness</a> invested £250,000 on ‘immersive fitness’ — a purpose-built studio featuring a 270-degree VR screen.</p>
<h5 id="3f67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Powerdot</h5>
<p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EvlcPrQSG_Dbatn2mKWufA.png" alt="app developers uk powerdot" width="617" height="564" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EvlcPrQSG_Dbatn2mKWufA.png" /></p>
<p id="1e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.powerdot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.powerdot.com/">Powerdot</a> is an electric muscle stimulation device, which promises to activate your muscle fibres at any stage of your workout — before, during or after. It may look like a torture machine (and it probably feels like one too), but the Powerdot promises to decrease muscle tension, increase blood flow, improves muscle strength and prepare muscles for training — depending on which ‘workout’ you select.</p>
<p id="0198" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using the Powerdot app, users can select the muscle group they’d most like to target, and the Powerdot will then send electrical impulses to that part of their body.</p>
<p id="12a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The product costs a hefty £274.99, but if your January DOMS are almost too much to bear, it might just be worth it.</p>
<h5 id="afdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">MUHDO Genetic Profiling</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aZ56YTu2E2EFBHFahQjJHA.png" alt="muhdo app developers uk" width="800" height="564" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aZ56YTu2E2EFBHFahQjJHA.png" /></div>
<p id="09b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If strapping an electrical muscle stimulation device to your chest seems a little OTT, perhaps you’re better suited to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://muhdo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://muhdo.com/">MUHDO</a>. Using advanced and comprehensive genetic profiling, MUHDO creates personalised health and fitness plans based on your unique gene functions.</p>
<p id="719f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So how does it work? Well, your genetic data is analysed by experts, who then create a detailed report and personalised health and fitness plan. The plan is tailored to you; based on your specific goals and unique DNA. They also provide ongoing support, information and inspiration, giving you the best possible chance of achieving your health and fitness goals.</p>
<p id="db33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only downside is that you’ll still need to exercise and eat well, but that pretty much goes without saying when it comes to getting in shape. If you’ve got a spare £249.99 then what have you got to lose? — aside from those pesky pounds.</p>
<h5 id="3ea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fitbit Iconic</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bnDZVD_pVuE3PotRRUE_dA.png" alt="fitbit iconic app developers " width="493" height="431" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bnDZVD_pVuE3PotRRUE_dA.png" /></div>
</div>
<p id="50a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We’re well aware that only a year ago we wrote a piece heavily questioning the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">accuracy and effectiveness of wearable fitness trackers</a> like the market leading Fitbit but hey, we’re still here and still chubby so maybe it’s time to give it another go.</p>
<p id="15a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.fitbit.com/ionic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.fitbit.com/ionic">Iconic</a> is Fitbit’s latest attempt to get the nation exercising. It features dynamic personal coaching, the ability to both store and play music without the use of a smartphone, a built-in GPS, heart rate tracker and multi-sport analysis.</p>
<p id="a60e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Iconic certainly feels a bit more ‘smartwatch-y’ than its predecessors, and for this reason we’re willing to give it a try. The downside? It costs £239.00. However, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Ionic-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Smoke/dp/B074KBP5RV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514974432&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fitbit+iconic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Ionic-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Smoke/dp/B074KBP5RV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514974432&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fitbit+iconic">Amazon</a> are on hand to save our waistlines as they’ve put it on sale for £239. Time to start training.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile app development is not always smooth sailing.  There&#8217;s only so much you and your brand new Macbook Pro can do, and unless you are highly skilled in market research, mobile app design, code writing and QA, you may need a bit of help!</p>
<p>But trawling through google trying to find the perfect <a href="http://borneagency.com/">mobile app development company</a> can be time-consuming and, let&#8217;s face it, a tad boring. Perhaps there&#8217;s the temptation to throw in the towel and abandon your idea altogether. But if you&#8217;ve got something good, it&#8217;s worth sticking with. We&#8217;ve seen entrepreneurs go from zero to hero, and it looks fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Mobile App Agency or Freelancers?</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to freelancers, app development agencies bring a depth of multi-disciplinary experience to your project. The combination of specialism and size may ensure the company is in a better position to deliver a larger scale project, however if it&#8217;s something simple like a logo design, hiring a freelancer could be more cost effective.</p>
<p>Our team have put together a failsafe guide to hiring a mobile app development company. Regardless of the size of your project, these top tips will help you to hire the right team for you, ensuring your product gets the best possible start in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1: Ask Around</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of our own clients come to us via referrals. Start ups often overlook the size of their network, and there is no better way to find the right app development company for you than through word of mouth.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the world of tech by attending some start up events &#8211; for those of you who are London based <a href="http://www.tech.london/events">Tech.London</a> is a great place to start. Network with other entrepreneurs and discuss their experiences have been with different companies. Even if they don&#8217;t have experience with mobile app developers specifically, they are bound to have some useful insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2: Show Them You Mean Business</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do you have to make sure that the app developers are the right people to take on your project, you also have to be a good fit for them. At Borne, we only take on projects which we can see the client is passionate about, and only if they have a well thought out plan for the future. We encourage our clients to think of us as partners and work with us on a one-to-one basis. Let&#8217;s just say, if we met our clients at the pub on a Friday night, it wouldn&#8217;t be awkward.</p>
<p>So, we recommend spending some time preparing for your initial meeting with answers to any questions you think that you might be asked. Bring with you a list of apps you enjoy using with the reasons why in order to help the team get a sense of what you are like, as well as designs you love. We tend to know what apps we enjoy using, but working out <em>why </em>is a different matter. Is it the ease of use? The colour scheme? It&#8217;s worth putting some thought into these in order to make the kick off meeting as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p>Arrive at the meeting with a clear description of what your app is going to be, how it will benefit the user, and a list of features the app must have. Arriving prepared allows the design and development team to see that you have actually taken time to think through your idea.</p>
<p>If the developers can see you are serious, they are far more likely to take on your project. Take the time to go through everything with your potential development team, ensure no stone is left unturned and the development process will run a lot more smoothly.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 3: Look At Their Previous Work</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you should never sign an app development contract without seeing examples of the work they have already produced.  You wouldn&#8217;t invest money in a house you haven&#8217;t seen, and with app development, the stakes are far higher (or maybe it&#8217;s only us who think that).</p>
<p>A good mobile app development company should have excellent UI/UX skills, but don&#8217;t just take their word for it. It&#8217;s worth downloading some of their apps to see how they actually work, as opposed to just nodding along to a selection of screenshots.</p>
<p>The apps should have great designs with excellent user interfaces. Pay attention to the small features, such as how neatly text fits into boxes and whether the buttons line up. Is the app easy to use? The tone consistent? It&#8217;s all in the detail. Little inconsistencies can ruin the whole feel of your app.</p>
<p>If possible, check client references. Look for app developers who can give you details of their previous clients. Ask these clients about the company&#8217;s ability to work to a deadline, overall value for money, general feedback and their willingness to recommend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 4: Cover All Bases</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never sign anything until you know exactly what services you will be paying for. Some app development companies will only develop, others will only design and some will do it all, from brand identity to QA testing.</p>
<p>Most clients find they want the same development company working on all aspects of the project. It ensures the team really get to know the brand, the design and the target market and would be in a better position to offer help with <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-post-app-launch-priorities/">post-launch marketing</a> if required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>Tip 5: Be Specific</u></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of being specific cannot be overemphasised. Without a clear understanding of the direction you want to take your project, there is very little your mobile app developers can do.</p>
<p>A good development company will listen intently to your project pitch, take notes and ask insightful questions, even bringing up potential problems your project may face before they arise.</p>
<p>When presented with a business requirement document, ensure you go through it thoroughly, line by line, before signing anything. This is no iTunes terms and conditions, a BRD is serious stuff and deserves your time. The more specific you are at the initial stages the better, as it means less changes will have to be made (which will cost you time and money) further down the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Be Realistic </span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App development doesn&#8217;t come cheap. It&#8217;s a huge investment which is why it&#8217;s so important to ensure you choose the right company. It is important however, not to be driven solely by price. Selecting a mobile app development company because they offer you the best price is not a good idea, and you may find that they cut corners further down the line.</p>
<p>While budgeting is highly important, cheaper options can end up costing more in the future. Don&#8217;t get ripped off, but don&#8217;t be a cheapskate either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Consider A Local Agency</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not completely necessary, choosing a development company local to you can make designing and developing your project a hell of a lot easier. We regularly have clients come in to see us, sometimes to talk about the app, sometimes just for a decent cup of coffee and a chat about how our day is going.</p>
<p>All to often, feedback and comments can get lost in a stream of emails, making everyone&#8217;s lives more difficult. Plus, you can never really determine anyone&#8217;s true feelings via email, and there&#8217;s always a chance that something will get misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 7: Listen To Feedback</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your developers are friends, not foes. In an ideal world, the development team should give you feedback wherever possible, and it&#8217;s important that even if you don&#8217;t agree, you still take what they say onboard. Although you may disagree on certain aspects of the project and they will do their best to accommodate your preferences, remember that if you&#8217;ve hired the right app developers, they will have experience in creating <em>successful</em> apps. They will know the current trends in the App Store, the sorts of design that works and most fitting colour scheme for your brand. In fact, if your mobile app developers are quiet and repeatedly accommodating throughout your project, that&#8217;s when you should worry. No one&#8217;s idea is <em>that </em>good.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on giving constructive feedback to our clients, guiding them wherever possible into making the best decisions for their project. If you have a large team of app developers, ensure they give feedback on your idea and listen to what they have to say. Actually listen.</p>
<p>Chances are, they know better than anyone what works best and will want your app to succeed as much as you do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 8: Have A Post-Launch Plan</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood, sweat and tears have paid off and now hooray, the app is finished! Although&#8230;it&#8217;s not finished.  It&#8217;s far from finished.</p>
<p>Your app is never actually &#8216;finished&#8217; and ensure your developers know this. There is always more to be done, whether it&#8217;s fixing bugs, developing new features for users or starting work on version two.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss maintenance and updates at the beginning of the process. Then, once the app is signed off and launched, get to work on making it even better. Having a maintenance plan in place at the start of the project means no one is caught off guard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s Wordwide Developers Conference kicked off yesterday and the event was, as expected, filled to the brim with new features, major announcements and not-so-subtle attempts to put Google back in their place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of the event so far:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HomePod</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Apple&#8217;s Siri speaker is finally here (well, in December).</p>
<p>It looks like an old Mac Pro, stands at a modest 7 inches tall and is powered by the A8 chipset. Users can use it in the same way they would Amazon Echo or Google Home, but Apple&#8217;s HomePod has a few little extras to make it stand out.</p>
<p>HomePod uses the A8 chip to monitor the space in the room and change its sound accordingly. The &#8216;Musicologist&#8217; feature works alongside Apple Music and can be accessed by talking to Siri &#8211; who can now handle complicated questions, play music on demand or send iMessages..</p>
<p>It will be available in black and white, and costs $349. A valiant effort but so far we can&#8217;t see it knocking Echo off the top spot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iOS 11</span></p>
<p>This is a big one for us as, let&#8217;s face it, we could spend hours exploring Apple&#8217;s latest iOS updates. Like every year, Apple showcased their latest iOS update and got the tongues wagging of mobile app developers all around the globe.</p>
<p>Packed full of new features, iOS 11 definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Siri&#8217;s voice is now much less robotic thanks to machine learning, and it&#8217;ll use on-device learning to improve users&#8217; iOS experiences. Siri will also speak in another language for you, which is great news for the 80% of Brits who communicate with non-English speakers by speaking English with a slightly foreign accent.</p>
<p>Siri is also learning to predict the users&#8217; next moves and will offer suggestions based on previous behaviours. It&#8217;ll learn interests, suggest related topics in News or will add related words to QuickType suggestions.</p>
<p>Other features in iOS 11 include the addition of person-to-person payments in Apple Pay and the ability to send money through iMessages. Photos and videos will take up less space, and a long exposure mode is being added to the camera. Apple Maps will be updated with lane guidance and speed limits displayed, as well as indoor maps of department stores. Users will be able to see what their friends are listening to on Apple Music (this has the potential to be mildly embarrassing), and the App Store is getting a total redesign and will look a lot more similar to the current layout of Apple Music.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WatchOS 4</span></p>
<p>Apple are adding several new faces, including a Siri face to the WatchOS 4. This face will automatically display the information which is most important to you and simply lifting your wrist will display this relevant information. This face will provide traffic information, reminders, news headlines and other location/time specific information.</p>
<p>The activity app is also getting updated. New workout challenges will be added, alongside a high intensity interval training mode. While we&#8217;re sceptical about the actual usefulness of fitness watches (read more <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">here</a>), we&#8217;re glad to see Apple doing their bit to combat the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>However the most exciting feature of the WatchOS 4 is the Toy Story-related watchfaces. The new faces will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz Lightyear, and if that&#8217;s not the best piece of techie news you&#8217;ve heard this year than you need to take a long hard look at yourself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacOS 10.13 High Sierra</span></p>
<p>Although a bit of a mouthful, the new version of macOS has a number of useful improvements. Photos will be easier to sort through, with Apple allowing users to filter them by order or tag. Photo editor will also be much more user friendly, with new tools available such as Curve. Updates to Safari will help to block site trackers &#8211; meaning you won&#8217;t be plagued with headphone adverts for 10 months after you&#8217;ve actually bought the headphones.</p>
<p>Updates also include Apple&#8217;s new file system, APFS, which will make moving files around much quicker and simultaneously free up space.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.5 Inch iPad Pro </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually software that is announced at the WWDCs, so whenever a new piece of hardware is introduced, our app developers and designers will spend the next few days deciding who&#8217;s going to take one for the team and buy it first.</p>
<p>This year, Apple introduced the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro, featuring a 12-megapixel camera and a 7-megapixel selfie camera, alongside 10 hours of battery life. The large screen allows for a full size onscreen keyboard and it also supports HBR video. Apple Pencil will be more responsive thanks to the new ProMotion feature &#8211; which increases the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz.</p>
<p>Finally it features a six-core A10X Fusion Chip with a 30% CPU performance improvement and a 40% graphics improvement. Notes has a built in document scanner and tapping with the Apple Pencil will lead you directly to the Notes app.</p>
<p>The 10.5-inch iPAd Pro will start at 64GB and costs $649.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iMac Update</span></p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s updated the iMac line which has gone down a storm with our app designers who are already whipping out their credit cards while committing themselves to a life of porridge and packed lunches. The new line includes an iMac 21.50inch and iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inc, with better storage, screens and the latest Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen processors.</p>
<p>The latest iMacs are shipping now but don&#8217;t be too hasty, as Apple also announced the high-end iMac Pro with with a Space Grey finish, a 27-inch screen, 18 cores in its processor and 16GB of VRAM. Start saving!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve developed your app and have been given the App Store go ahead? Well, that&#8217;s really only half the battle.</p>
<p>According to a study done by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/">TechCrunch</a>, nearly one in four users abandon an app after just one use, so not only do you have to <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/do-something-different/">drive downloads</a>, you will also need to work to keep your users interested.</p>
<p>Luckily, we know a thing or two about mobile app engagement, Here&#8217;s our top tips and tricks to keep your users engaged, interested and coming back for more&#8230;</p>
<p><u>Have An Engaging App To Begin With!</u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re hoping that before you even start developing your app you will know its purpose, but this is something to keep in mind to ensure you don&#8217;t go off track.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As mobile app developers, we are always reiterating to our clients how important it is that the app actually adds some sort of <em>value </em>to their user&#8217;s life. Whether that&#8217;s by eliminating boredom on the bus, helping them find the <a href="http://www.getstreats.com">best places to eat in London</a>, or managing their finances &#8211; each app must serve a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An app simply cannot succeed if there is no clear use for it. You can have the best UI design, complex features and a million pound marketing budget; but if your users are not immediately hooked, it&#8217;s likely that your app will eventually be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So our number one tip for making sure users keep returning to your app? Have an app that&#8217;s good in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seamless On-Boarding</span></p>
<p>A quick and simple on-boarding experience is essential in reducing abandonment rates. Asking for too many details or making sign-up confusing will result in users throwing in the towel and deleting your app, possibly to never return to it again. It&#8217;s essential that your sign-up is as pain-free as possible for the user.</p>
<p>Seamless on-boarding means only asking for essential information and not confusing your user with too many features or too much text. The user should be able to sign-up in very few steps. Remember, this is the part of the app where you really cannot afford to make any mistakes. Users may forgive a small niggle later on, but as during sign up they have not yet discovered what your app can actually do for them, they are far more likely to abandon it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Engage With Your Users!</span></p>
<p>App engagement is a two way street &#8211; you cannot expect users to engage with your app regularly if you do not respond to them, and we don&#8217;t<em> </em>mean a generic &#8216;you haven&#8217;t logged on in a while&#8217; pop-up!</p>
<p>Used in the right way, push notifications and reminders are a great way to keep your users engaged and ensure that your app is always in the back of their minds. Pushing strategies should, of course, be <em>user </em>centred, and not just a blind stab at encouraging them to open up your app &#8211; irrelevant or &#8216;spammy&#8217; push notifications are more than likely to end in a rage quit.</p>
<p>Specific reminders or incentives however, are a good place to start. Take advantage of user data &#8211; such as location or interests. These will allow you to tailor your notifications to each specific user, ensuring they are are relevant, personal and, most importantly, actually useful.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listen To Feedback</span></p>
<p>User feedback is hugely important when it comes to keeping your app up to date and in tip-top condition. Don&#8217;t just rely on the testing provided by your app development company &#8211; they are more likely to focus on ironing out the bugs and polishing off certain features. Realistically, there is no substitute for feedback from people who will actually be using your app, so <em>listen </em>to any comments you are given and respond to it. Updating content, adding new features and refining your UI regularly will be sure to keep your users interested.</p>
<p>Tracking which screens or features may cause users to drop off is another essential. We recommend using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/">Firebase Analytics</a> to monitor user behaviour within the app and see which features may or may not be working.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage Social Sharing</span></p>
<p>We write a lot about the <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-2-using-instagram-to-drive-downloads/">power of social media</a> when it comes to driving downloads, but it can also be used to increase user engagement.</p>
<p>Allow users to easily share their progress or results on Facebook and you guarantee both a higher engagement rates and more visibility for your product. A great example of this is by fitness app <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>. After each run, the user is asked if they wish to share their running stats to Facebook or Twitter. Doing this will have a number of effects. It will inspire a healthy dose of competition in your user&#8217;s friends, ensure that the name of your app reaches people who may have similar interests, and also encourages your user to keep returning in order to impress their friends and followers!</p>
<p>Another great option is to offer incentives for sharing. Many games offer points or access to secret levels if the user shares their progress on social media, and this is definitely something to consider. If done correctly, these incentives will increase user engagement and continue to drive downloads, as more people want in on the action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1149" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Browse-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-20-at-16.23.54.png" alt="mobile app developers " width="719" height="561" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been scrolling through Instagram, downloading a workout or manically swiping right on Tinder (hey, we&#8217;ve all been there) and stopped to wander how these apps actually came to exist then read on.</p>
<p>This post will explain the ins, the outs and the methods used in mobile app development. We could spew out some complicated tech jargon to make us sound intelligent but luckily, we&#8217;re not like that. The point of this blog is to emphasize that anyone really can create a winning app &#8211; all you need is imagination, dedication and a couple of app developers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Every app development company will vary in their services offered, but they will all follow roughly the same formula when it comes to developing the product. This blog will explain our processes, how we work with our clients and the methods we use to turn a single idea into an app so addictive it gives people thumb cramp.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Work</span></p>
<p>We use the Waterfall Model in all our projects &#8211; which sounds a lot more glam than it really is. Essentially, this allows our clients to stay involved, as we are regularly providing them with a set of deliverables. They can keep up to date with the progress of their project and make sure that we are working to their standard, timeline and specifications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Do We Even Begin?</span></p>
<p>So many people have an idea for a great app, yet are never given an outlet to produce it. They aren&#8217;t confident in their idea, don&#8217;t understand tech talk or, in many cases, simply have no idea where to begin.</p>
<p>In our initial kick-off meeting we attempt to extract these great ideas (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t involve surgery). We want to get the ball rolling, the creative juices flowing and the ideas bouncing back and forth. We&#8217;re aware this sounds very hap-hazard and hipster, but trust us, it works. We even provide sweets just in case we&#8217;re not quite buzzing enough on tech talk.</p>
<p>When we have settled on something more concrete, our Project Manager will begin structuring the project, making sure the app is both feasible and possible. A first app should be the minimum viable product or MVP (we will write more on this in a future post), so the PM&#8217;s job at this stage is to stop the client getting too carried away adding more and more features. We&#8217;ve seen the &#8216;kid in the ice cream shop&#8217; scenario happen too many times, and trust us, it never ends well. The temptation to add something else is always there, so we need to make sure that what we develop really is the MVP, something which can be expanded on once we have some real user feedback.</p>
<p>From here, the PM will put together the functional spec. This contains a full list of the app&#8217;s features. It needs to be thoroughly examined by both client and developers, to make sure the requirements and timeline match up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design</span></p>
<p>Once the functional spec has been signed off on both sides, we&#8217;re ready to start creating the product. Our two Lead Designers, Elliott and Cris, are creative and passionate &#8211; skills which more than make up for their average to poor levels of office banter.</p>
<p>The design is done in two parts. We begin with the UX (user experience), which is the most logical representation of the functional spec. Don&#8217;t panic, this will not look like the real thing. Or, if it does, we can only apologise. Full UX design with a list of the functionalities is for the Developers mainly &#8211; they&#8217;re an extremely intelligent bunch and see things in a different way to the Average Joe. We will deliver the UX design in a user-friendly format to the client. Once that has been signed off we can get cracking with the next phase of design.</p>
<p>UI (user interface) design is where the fun really starts. This is where all the client&#8217;s branding, artistic and colour scheme dreams come true (there is no judgement here for dreaming of colour schemes). We want to achieve the right look and feel of the product, so our Designers work closely with the client to make sure it looks as close to how they envisioned as possible. Now and again the client pops in to see us, which we like to think is because we are great people to be around, but it&#8217;s just because we have really nice coffee.</p>
<p>Once the UI design is delivered and signed off, there are high fives all round and we might even make the Designers a cup of tea. After that: development begins (cue dramatic music).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation &amp; Verification </span></p>
<p>It is a common misconception that testing is done at the end of the project, however we&#8217;re firm believers that we should identify and fix unexpected results at each stage of a project, rather than allowing problems to escalate &#8211; resulting in nervous breakdowns all round.</p>
<p>The development and testing phase of the project is where everything starts to get a bit techie and, depending on the size of your app, this can take anything from 4 days to 1 year.</p>
<p>The first step in the development process is for our Front End Developers to translate the visual design laid out by our designers into a clickable prototype. A clickable prototype does what it says on the tin, you can move between screens and experiment with transitions &#8211; however none of the functionality has yet been applied.</p>
<p>Following this we work to implement some of the more basic API endpoints such as registration and profile creation before releasing an alpha build to the client. An alpha build will still be very &#8220;raw&#8221; but will have passed stringent QA acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Only when the app passes our QA team&#8217;s extremely high standards and the core functionality is in a usable state will we release the first build we consider a &#8220;beta&#8221;. The beta stage is the first chance to start testing the full flow of a mobile application, from registration through to completing all user journeys. Stress testing continuously to mimic real world usage; at this stage we will be looking for bugs, unexpected behaviour and crashes.</p>
<p>There is usually a large amount of work to do between the first beta build and an app that is fit for the app store, often an app will go through multiple beta releases that progressively get closer to your launch specification. Only once all the bugs have been ironed out will the build be considered &#8220;launch ready”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance<br />
</span></p>
<p>Just because the app has launched doesn&#8217;t mean the work is done. If the client signs a maintenance package with us, our PM will develop a plan with weekly sprints to develop and support all features of the product. If something goes wrong, we are onto it. From here, the client can start collecting some analytics and stats, helping them to plan for the second version of their product.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Version 2</span></p>
<p>They say you only start really learning to drive once you&#8217;ve passed your driving test and the same could be said for apps. Once we get some real user feedback we can work out what we can do to make it better, and that is when we start work on version 2. This also is the time for the client to start adding in some new features, think about monetizing their app if they haven&#8217;t already, and gain some insights into how users have been responding so far.</p>
<p>We hope this post has encouraged you and made you realise that mobile app development isn&#8217;t quite as complicated as it may first appear. Please <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact/">get in touch</a> if you want to know a bit more about the services we offer, or just fancy a chat about how your day is going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naming your app is like naming your baby, but more important.</p>
<p>The name of your app, alongside the logo, is the first thing users will see, so it needs to be good. No pressure, but this is one of the most important decisions you will make in your entire life&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok we&#8217;re only joking. Whilst the name is important, with the right team of app developers and a high quality app which is actually <em>useful,</em> you&#8217;ll be on the path to success. But, for those of you who are getting bogged down trying to pick a name, we have put our techie heads together and come up with some tips to help you out.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short and snappy</span></p>
<p>Painfully obvious but painfully ignored. The name of your app needs to be short. Apple recommends keeping the app&#8217;s name to under 25 characters, which isn&#8217;t much, especially when compared to our 140-character Twitter allowance, something we still struggle with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Choose something catchy, easy to remember and easy to pronounce. If it&#8217;s hard to say then none of your users will talk about it for fear of being embarrassed (we&#8217;ve all been there). Essentially, don&#8217;t try to be too clever. Don&#8217;t try to be too techie. Don&#8217;t add excessive numbers or random capital letters. Just&#8230;be cool.</p>
<p>Describing the function of the app alongside something a bit punchy generally works well. Think Evernote, Wunderlist or Dubsmash.</p>
<p><u>Keywords</u></p>
<p>Keywords are both a blessing and a curse. They are what keeps us marketers awake long into the night, wondering what went wrong and what we could possibly have done differently.</p>
<p>And for app developers, keywords are a nightmare. We want the apps we launch to be high quality and clean. We want the UI and UX to sell itself, for users to rave about the app&#8217;s perfection and get thumb-ache from excessive use (OK not really).</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to waste precious characters trying to squeeze in a pesky keyword.</p>
<p>But, if used sensitively, keywords can do wonders for your app store rankings and, if your existing user base consists solely of your mum and your computer-illiterate Nan, then they are essential. Try not to spam. Be strategic. We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8217;ll say it again, be cool &#8211; and also read <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/app-store-optimisation/">this post</a> where we go into keywords in more detail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Competition</span></p>
<p>When you start brainstorming ideas, Google everything. Absolutely everything. There&#8217;s nothing more heartbreaking then coming up with the perfect name and then finding out someone named Mark Zuckerberg already trademarked it. Ugh.</p>
<p>Adding punctuation or changing the spelling of a competitors name is neither fun nor clever. Do this, and you risk looking unprofessional. Users download apps that they trust, and no one trusts a copy cat.</p>
<p>Remember that just because your name might be available in the App Store doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s available everywhere. You will need social media handles and a domain name, so it&#8217;s worth checking these are available too.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Talk to your app developers</span></p>
<p>An experienced app development company will know the industry inside out, and they will know what works. When it comes to trends in app design, names and logos, mobile app developers know what&#8217;s hot and what&#8217;s not. Make sure you get their advice!</p>
<p>When we partner with clients, we put a lot of effort into creating fun and imaginative branding workshops, where we go through everything from logo design, to name, to colour palettes.  Have a look at our <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/hiring-the-perfect-app-developer/">guide to hiring an app development company</a> if you&#8217;re unsure what you should be looking for, but essentially, your app developers should offer valuable insights and ideas.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#8217;t be scared</span></p>
<p>Finally, don&#8217;t be scared to go with something a little abstract, a little funky, a little &#8216;out there&#8217;. Remember, at the end of the day, you want to stand out from the competition and a name that gets people wanting to know more can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Whilst we appreciate choosing a name for your app can be difficult, stressful, exhausting &#8211; you name it, it really doesn&#8217;t have to be. With the right app development company and a strong MVP, you will be well on your way to App Store success.</p>
