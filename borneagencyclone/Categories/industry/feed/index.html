				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been an increased global demanded for a more personalised mobile experience, so a widespread adaption of deep learning and AI in the mobile app development industry is inevitable. We can forget about latency issues that crop up in cloud computing and mobile sensing. Close to zero latency is here, with real-time data processing speeds which delivers optimum results.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Bionic smartphone chips by Apple, built-in neural processing units help neural networks run directly on-device at an amazing speed. Using Google’s ML Kit and Apple’s Core ML, deep learning libraries like Keras and TensorFLow Lite, our developers can create products with fewer errors, faster data processing and lower latency.</p>
<p>A huge advantage of on-device machine learning is that it can offer users an accurate, seamless user experience. Since you do not have to question if data has been sent for processing, you will get an improved privacy, data protection and user security. Also, with neural networks on mobile devices, you do not need to connect to the internet to access every feature of your app. By using mobile device computing capabilities to implement deep learning, it has greatly improved mobile device usability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why You Should Be Incorporating Deep Learning Algorithms:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Augmented Reality and Immersive Capabilities</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore platforms, developers can build AR apps that can juxtapose digital environments and objects with realistic settings. Mobile-based AR’s immersive capabilities are having a significant impact on entertainment, travel, retail and other industries. Looking at brands Like Sephora or Lacoste, they allow their customers to try on products with AR apps and a growing number of shoppers prefer to check out products on their phones before taking the plunge, especially in today’s times where people can try things on in-store. Interactive AR games like Ghostbusters World, Ingress and Pokemon received a cult following and received extensive press. Also, if you’re looking for navigation, Google Maps Live View will provide you with real-time navigation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong>On-device machine learning has made things easier in complying with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It guarantees security in your data, as you don’t need to upload encryption, biometrics or to a cloud or server for processing.</p>
<p>On-device automatic encryption is another useful smartphone feature that protects your content with a pattern, password, PIN and allows access to your data only when you unlock your phone. This way, if your device is stolen or it is lost, the chance of someone having access to your data is negligible. The iPhone’s Face ID feature is an example of a more secure smartphone experience. The on-device neural networks in the Apple smartphone chips process and safely store user facial data. The identification happens on the device, so your security and privacy remain unimpeded. Google Pixel 4’s Face Unlock tech, uses 3D IR depth mapping to create your face models for face recognition and stores them on an on-device Titan M6 security chip. Face Unlock works well with the 1Password app which offers users biometric security by eliminating the chance of fraud identity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Speech Recognition</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Speech recognition involves transducing or transforming input sequences into output sequences using recurrent neural networks (RNN), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and other architectures. Developers struggled with the issue of latency which will create delays between the automated assistant’s response and the request given. But, we can get around this by using the compact recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) tech in mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>RNN-Ts are sequence-to-sequence models. Rather than following methods that have been followed previously of processing an entire input sequence before producing an output, however, they maintain a steady continuity in their input processing and output streaming. This facilitates the processing of real-time speech. We can see this in Google Assistant, which can process consecutive voice commands without faltering and without requiring you to say ‘Hey, Google’ after before each request. This creates a more conversational flow, and the assistant will follow your instructions precisely. Want to find a photo in one of your folders? Looking for a guided route to a friend’s place? Consider it sorted.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>High Quality Photos</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High quality photographs are an important criterion for buyers when selecting smartphones, which they can get with many of the latest models. These come equipped with the hardware components: image central processing units (CPUs), image signal processors, deep learning image algorithms, and neural processing units that have catapulted smartphones into a new realm from traditional cameras.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Accurate Image Recognition</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you pair on-device machine learning with image classification technology, you can identify and receive detailed information in real-time with about anything you encounter. Looking to read a foreign language text? Scan it with your mobile device and get an accurate instant translation. See a piece of furniture that you are keen on? Scan it to get information about where you can buy it and the price. By facilitating image recognition in real-time, apps like Calorie Mama, Google Lens and Leafsnap are increasingly mobile’s devices’ usability and learnability and enhancing user experience.</p>
<p>The possibilities of on-device machine learning are endless. With the increase of efficient intelligent algorithms, increase in power for AI chips and deeper neural networks, digital products incorporating deep learning mobile will be the expected standard in retail, banking, health care, data analytics and various other industries. As deep learning capabilities continue to improve, mobile devices’ usability features will evolve alongside and will continue to flourish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to digital products, swiping right isn’t just about finding Ms or Mr Right in the dating world anymore. Employers are increasingly turning to recruitment apps to find the right candidate who will match a company’s specific criteria effectively. Recruitment apps can present current information about available candidates to recruitment agencies. Recruitment apps also open these positions to possible prospects. Therefore, these apps help employers and candidates connect. With the market of corporate recruitment software estimated to reach $1.5 billion, and 65% of candidates searching for employment opportunities on mobile devices, the future for digital transformation in the recruitment sector is a bright one.</p>
<p>When we are looking at the recruitment sector, digital transformation has been front and centre. According to a recent survey, 74% of businesses either have a digital strategy in place or are in the process of implementing one. Given the proven ability of digital tools to drive innovation and efficiency, this level of interest is hardly surprising. Nowadays, machine learning and intelligent automation are boosting productivity and optimising a vast range of back-office operations. Cloud-based platforms, mobile applications and data analytics are redefining the way businesses are engaging with their customers.</p>
<p>However, many businesses seem to be stalling on their journey towards digital disruption and a lack of talent and skill are fundamental obstacles. Among hiring executives that were surveyed who have put a digital strategy in place, 59% of these say they lack migration skills and integration, 64% cited a need for security expertise and 54% required more strategic digital transformation skills. Large enterprises have a more difficult time during the recruitment process than its smaller competitors, which is compounding marketplace disruption.</p>
<p><strong>New and Old Skills on Demand</strong></p>
<p>Talent requirements from various parties are extremely diverse. On one hand, businesses are faced with longstanding struggles to fill specific positions in Java and SAP, this tech is deeply embedded in the essentials of managing enterprise environments. At the same time however, over the past few years, the demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS), DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) and other cloud-based related approaches have increased significantly.</p>
<p>Also, businesses are focusing more on using automation and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to boost and enhance values that are strategic. This would create a need for skills around robotic process automation (RPA) deployment, as well as analytics and data science to leverage the capabilities of smart tools. There is a crossover when traditional skills as well as new talent reflects the broader picture that business may be facing today. While technical innovation is the primary goal, the reality is that modernising while maintaining existing operations remain essential priorities. The key in all of this is finding the optimal mix of skills – one that can integrate legacy systems with new tech to drive the transformational outcomes for tech.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2627 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1.jpg?_t=1589554109" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1.jpg 600w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/recruitment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Traditionally, managing the steps of traditional recruitment practices has been labour-intensive and time consuming task that absorbs a significant portion of talent acquisition professionals’ time and energy. Nowadays, RPA tools can execute many of the mundane administrative tasks associated with managing the recruitment journey – these include pipelining candidates, capturing specific data, transferring day from one application to another, processing documents, auto texting and scheduling video interviews etc.</p>
<p>More advanced cognitive applications apply natural language processing capabilities which enables instant messaging-activated chatbots. These digital products can handle routine communications between candidates and recruiters such as descriptions of new job openings, updates to the application and communications as well as gathering data on questions important to hiring managers. Also, these specific chatbots can provide insights and metrics on the type of candidates that are applying for the specific role and the gaps required to close any lack of suitable candidates. Like other industries and job functions, intelligent automation has allowed recruiters to spend less time on routine, repetitive work and more time focused on activities that hold more value. For example, rather than filling out paperwork or responding to basic questions, they can devote extra time to interacting with candidates. Contrary to the common perception that recruitment and the hiring process are being taken over by faceless robots, technology is helping to humanise the function, specifically by allowing recruiters to spend more time where it counts.</p>
<p><strong>Buying vs. Building</strong></p>
<p>Talent acquisition specialists looking to deploy tech to enhance the recruitment process have a variety of off-the-shelf options to choose from. Cloud-based HR solutions are becoming increasingly commonplace and HR processes like offboarding and onboarding are prime candidates for RPA initiatives. In many cases, tailoring the capabilities to specific requirements can be a viable option.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2628 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136.jpg?_t=1589554153" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136.jpg 600w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shapr-Professional-Networking-App-1-e1506527746136-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Given the dynamic job market and the ease of accessing CV’s, recruiters can easily identify candidates who, on paper, are qualified to fill a role. What is more of a challenge is gaining deeper insight into a candidate’s specific skills, as well as their potential alignment with a company’s culture. Emerging data analytics capabilities are playing an increasingly prominent role to address this challenge. Recruiters are deploying algorithms that apply various criteria to evaluate personality assessments that determine if a specific candidate is likely to be a good fit. Some are applying these algorithms to candidates’ social media footprints to dig deeper into the intersection between business culture and personality to assess the percentage of likelihood that a candidate may accept an offer that you make. Analytics tools like R Analytics, Python, SaaS and Power BI are allowing hiring managers and recruiters to gain deeper insights about national and international talent pools, projected candidate costs and whether to fulfil a role with a contractor or employee.</p>
<p>While recruitment apps have taken great strides recently, the winners in this sector will be an entrepreneur who devises a product to engage candidates that are passively engaging. Recruiting apps work amazingly for both employers and recruiters that are actively looking. However, a LinkedIn study discovered that 85% of people are passively interested in new opportunities. When an app comes along that can connect these candidates to the right jobs, this product would emerge as a winner. Talent searches will never slow down, however that doesn’t mean that the way in which we approach this will not change. Recruitment products are on the rise, and they are not going anywhere anytime soon. When it comes to building an app, swiping right on this progression may just give you that edge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like other sectors that we have spoken about, the financial sector has recognised the potential for digital solutions, strategies and developments that are changing the face of our current economy.</p>
<p>However, digital ecosystems require more than just adopting change. To achieve resounding success, the institutes should go through structural reforms across external and internal processing systems. Organisations are now investing in technology to speed up their business endeavours as well as to differentiate from their competitors in the financial sector. Fintech is attracting customers with convenient services and products that have emerged from a single-source technology.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can the Financial Sector and Digital Transformation Integrate? </strong></h2>
<p>The transformation brought in by the digitalisation is more on the customer-front experience. The digital growth is directly proportionate to the convenience a digital product can provide to its’ customers. For example, credit companies and banks are now providing mobile facilities and experiences to their customers and eliminating hassles of visiting a branch for petty transactions and formalities. However, financial institutions like capital and equity markets still rely on age-old systems that run on IBM frames.</p>
<p>By taking a customer-centric approach, financial service providers are aiming to make their customer’s lives easier and unlocking opportunities in the functions of the financial domains like the capital market, credit facilities and banking. Using the right mediums of tech, the financial sector could outgrow their efficiency and surpass their own records when a successful implementation of the digital workforce can take place.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact of Finance and Digital Transformation</strong></h2>
<p>It goes beyond making digital products progressive and reaching out to their clientele, the Fintech industry takes digital transformation to develop an ecosystem of business models that call for an equality of participation from all corners of the sector.</p>
<p>Beyond the teams of people, the transformation majorly takes place in the capitalisation of new tech that could further enable the introduction of digital tools to enhance efficiency and productivity in the financial sector. An example of this is the transition from hardcopy documents to secured HTML or PDF formatted documents. Keeping in mind, it does come bearing risks of its own. The advent of cashless payments, mobile banking, and e-wallets have hiked the security threats cases recently. Tasks like making journal entries, depositing bills, allocations and receiving operations can now be assisted by replacing human involvement with robotics.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2621 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-1024x683.jpg?_t=1589184626" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-photo.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The financial sector has come up with strategies to implement automation and digitally transform the process. The act of automation comes with a set of regulations and rules that assist in achieving the high-performance goals and mitigate the operation risks.</p>
<p>Being strict on the guidelines of the applications, Fintechs must move on the lines of improved customer segmentation. Secondly, the enhancements in the design of products, services and promotional capabilities can shift from physical channels to a digital platform. The repetitive tasks like reports, analysis, accounting and similar operations can now be executed with robust strategies of the tech that minimises the errors and possibility of cyber risks.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Tools</strong></h2>
<p>There are specific tools for Fintech that serves the industry with systems focused on improving the existing systems that have been put in place.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2620 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0.jpg?_t=1589184591" alt="" width="960" height="709" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0.jpg 960w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0-300x222.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_dam_imageserve_862545030_960x0-768x567.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Visualisations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Data storage is a key area where there are multiple departments have struggled to maintain a uniformed funnel. The data visualisations gain insight by tracking the performance and trace the interactions that can forecast or predict current or future performances. This can be utilised to base decisions for profound improvements in the next stage of development.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Robotics </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction of robotic automation in the financial sector brought down the communications and processes to a minimum. Tasks like allocations, depositing bills and making journal entries can now be assisted by robotics and assist human involvement. Though the implementation is still in testing phase, banks have started installing bots at the entry gates of the branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The tech expedition has come up with the introduction of cloud computing. The financial sector took the advantage to enable effective interdepartmental collaborations using <a href="https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/drupal-saas">SaaS-Based cloud applications</a>. Tasks such as Human Resources and accounting is included in this and the core systems were incorporated and integrated. However, for functionalities like billing, payments and credit scoring, the same cloud structures cannot be used because the risk of personal data breaches cybercrimes is so high.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blockchain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The preferred tech in the financial sector is <a href="https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/can-drupal-and-blockchain-work-together">Blockchain</a>. This amalgamation ushered financial services in a new digital era in its truest form. Blockchain has empowered a new form of currency called cryptocurrency where the set of blocks of data is considered as a currency that you can exchange online. This is a breakthrough and the financial sector sounds promising as it limits the chance of fraud, addressed money laundering and this effectively pumped trading measures in the financial market. However, Blockchain has a long way to go and challenges to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Analytics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are various sectors in finance itself and it becomes a task to channel the massive influx of customer data. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is leveraged to effectively use advanced analytics that can anticipate customer behaviour. The algorithms of machine learning can identify the customer trends and analyse an online pattern that can be put to their advantage. For example, the apps store more frequently used services and then give suggestions based on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Does the Future Hold for Fintech?</strong></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/04/five-key-takeaways-from-the-2019-state-of-digital-sales-in-banking-report/">a study conducted in 2019</a>, 65% of banks have reached or are on the path to digital transformation. The two-dimensional platforms that serve both parties involved, advisors and clients, will take on these advancements. It will empower and shape the ecosystem by embracing new tech and tapping into the digital maturity of most today’s customers. With each new phase, the customers are also bridging their knowledge gaps on a learning curve of tech. It is only a matter of time before we witness a blooming of the financial sector where digital tools are used to bring an improved customer experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conservation and environmental charities have their profiles lifted through heightened media coverage on environmental issues that were brought to the surface over the years. While many are already on the radar for digital innovation, we should look are some of the most powerful conversations in social media and mobile, and how environmental charities have been using tech to supplement their calls for action.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Small-scale Charities are Keeping Green Shoppers on Point</strong></h2>
<p>Tech-focused, smaller charities are keeping shoppers closer to their green principles than ever with the explosion of shopping apps. The digital strategy is simple, being on mobile phones means that supporters can access information easily when, and wherever they are option.</p>
<p>A UPC scanner app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buycott.android&amp;hl=en_GB">Buycott,</a> helps those that are dedicated to making changes ensure that their purchases are fair and sustainable. The app works by compiling a global, extensive database of barcodes linked to manufacturers and shops. By scanning an items’ barcode, users of the app can decide based on research whether to continue with the purchase that they want to make. To help motivate specific causes, buycotts can be linked together to form campaigns on a global scale. These items are linked together on the platforms to pursue bans on GMO production, animal testing and unethical manufacturing practices. Other more focused shopping apps include <a href="http://ethicalbarcode.com/">Ethical Barcode</a>, which assists in food shoppers taking charge of where their food is coming from.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Using Images in Your Digital Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>The environmental charity <a href="https://www.instagram.com/friends_earth/?hl=en">Friends of the Earth</a> uses social media such as Instagram to support the climate action campaign. Their recent images included sea destruction in an outline of a person. This highlighted how eco-anxiety can be harnessed to action. Digital leaders have used these emotional video images to capture eco-anxiety and how we can work together to save the planet.</p>
<p>The use of footage and images of burning forests online have ratcheted up into a social media grassroots movement. Major environment and wildfire campaigns have resulted from the ground up. Through video content and social media campaigning, the WWF-UK Australia raised over £1 million in a week, showing the power that content and images have in corralling around causes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2611 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/unnamed.png?_t=1588240568" alt="" width="512" height="434" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/unnamed.png 512w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/unnamed-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 85vw, 512px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Fast Fashion: Slowing it Down</strong></h2>
<p>Fast fashion has become a huge topic in the media over the past few years. Fast fashion has helped send over 235 million items to the landfill each year, according to the London Sustainability Exchange. Apps are coming together to help recycle, slow down and encourage better use. <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/">Good on You</a> is a great example of this. Good on You is a sustainable shopping app which helps reduce food waste. They are endorsed by ethical fashion advocate Emma Watson. The app helps inform audiences on which brands are sustainable by rating in addition to an evaluation of the materials used in the clothing production process.</p>
<p>Working with conservation and environmental charities at the forefront is Google, showing how corporate charity partnerships can work. Perfect for charity digital leaders looking for a media and fundraising platform, <a href="https://onetoday.google.com/p/p0e1aur1">One Today features a menu of conservation and environment charities</a>. Each photo advertisement is crafted to suit each cause. The Nature Conservancy’s Restore Panda Habitat shows an endearing panda with its baby and includes a suggested donation amount for its habitat. For charities on the platform, transaction fees are waived by Google. For local charity leaders, <a href="https://www.google.org/our-work/google-impact-challenge/">Google also has an AI Impact Challenge which has a $ 25 million grant funding pool for charities looking to use AI</a> to address local environmental and social issues.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Charity Apps Showcase Collaborations and Partnerships</strong></h2>
<p>From local to global charities, charity apps have helped address some of the world’s most pressing challenges. However, for charity digital leaders looking to build up local knowledge of the environment, exemplary apps have helped utilise users and volunteers mobilise.</p>
<p>Hozelock, Garden Organic, Coventry University, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust and the Royal Horticultural Society have come together under a private-public citizen science tech venture. The partners have launched the Blooms for Bees app, which includes a mobile phone app. The app encourages users to go outside, observe plants and take videos and photos of bees to be uploaded for verification. They also worked together to identify the bee species and connect with your local environment. Data is then collected and used by their scientists and digital experts to assist in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Similar to the Blooms for Bees technology, the <a href="https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/birdtrack/taking-part/birdtrack-apps">British Trust for Ornithology</a> also has <a href="https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/birdtrack/taking-part/birdtrack-apps">an app</a> to engage supporters. Project developers include the RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland, BirdLife International, the Scottish Ornithologist’s Club, and the Welsh Ornithological Society. The project <a href="https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/birdtrack/taking-part/birdtrack-apps">BirdTrack</a> allows supporters to download an app to help manage individual bird sightings. For rare birds, records are sent to the partners for verification. Again, the big data is used to improve conservation efforts in targeted geographies.</p>
<p>Environmental and conservation charities have taken to tech and social media to heighten their call to action. Using digital products in growing organisations and amplifying their voice on environmental issues and making information easily accessible to the general public. Incorporating AI and digital products such as apps into environmental and charitable organisations will drive this sector forward and bring the attention that their causes needs that it greatly deserves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The battle to attract and retain talent has gained enormous traction over the past couple of years. During this uncertain time that we are all facing, the decrease of unemployment rates is only part of the whole picture. Today’s potential candidates have become much more selective. Increasingly, they are less is focused on remuneration and are gravitating towards companies that have embraced compelling mission statements, and are more focused on their positive contributions to their employer rather than monetary gains. Recruiters are currently feeling the crunch to step up to the plate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have become an essential part of the recruitment process in enhancing recruiting efforts.</p>
<h2><strong>Contextualise the Talent Pool to Expand Strategically</strong></h2>
<p>In the past, recruiters have selected candidates from a very limited talent pool. Given the fact that on average, recruiters spend an average of 13 hours per week sourcing candidates for one role, however there are only so many job applications and CV’s that they can sift through. AI’s unparalleled ability to rapidly sift through millions of data points enables recruiters to identify high-potential candidates quickly. With AI, recruiters can tap into a larger talent pool to source potential candidates, including social media platforms, agency databases and online career boards.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2607 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-10.40.46.png?_t=1587637146" alt="" width="523" height="483" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-10.40.46.png 523w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-10.40.46-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 85vw, 523px" /></p>
<p>One of the most lucrative upshots of incorporating AI into recruitment efforts is the ability to efficiently and effectively identify passive candidates. <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf">70%</a> of the global workforce is comprised of passive candidates. Ignoring or devaluing the potential of this talent pool can cripple recruiting effectiveness. There’s a reason that<a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/202646/Entelo%27s%202018%20Recruiting%20Trends%20Report.pdf?t=1530708036795"> 98%</a> of talent teams state that passive candidates are an important source of talent—passive candidates are a staggering<a href="https://www.jobvite.com/sourcing-and-nurturing/passive-positive/"> 120%</a> more likely to make a strong impact.</p>
<p>Former employees and former applicants represent another often overlooked, yet lucrative demographic that can enhance recruiting efforts. Companies are sitting on a gold mine of thousands of CV’s that represent lucrative talent. AI has an ability to sift through a company’s existing database of CV’s and identify former applicants who are qualified for current job vacancies. Because former candidates have already expressed their interest in the employer, the recruiting cycle can be dramatically curtailed. AI-powered tools like <a href="https://ideal.com/product/sourcing/rediscovery/">Ideal</a>,  help recruiters identify candidates included in a company’s existing CV database to surface candidates that match the qualifications associated with the specific role.</p>
<h2><strong>Bias Reduction</strong></h2>
<p>The recruitment process has traditionally been laden with bias. <a href="https://engage.montagetalent.com/diversity-and-inclusion.html">Nearly half of applicants’ report</a> having experienced discrimination in the hiring process. Given the fact that companies with diverse workforces perform better financially than their less diverse counterparts.</p>
<p>One of the primary inhibitors of diversity in the recruiting process is the historical emphasis on candidate referrals. Talent acquisition teams rank employee referrals as the most important source of candidates. However, relying on or prioritising employee referrals comes at a cost. Itmanifests in the psychological phenomenon known as the “similarity principle”. We are more likely to like people who share similar backgrounds and beliefs. Therefore, employees are incentivised to refer candidates that are like themselves. This would drastically reduce the diversity of the candidate pool. Especially considering that almost one quarter of companies do not have a diversity hiring initiative in place.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2608 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/www.biospace.jpg?_t=1587637222" alt="" width="625" height="350" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/www.biospace.jpg 625w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/www.biospace-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Reducing unconscious and conscious bias in the hiring process should be top-of-mind for recruiters. Fortunately, quality need not come at the price of diversity. AI-powered tools like<a href="https://textio.com/"> Textio</a> help companies craft more inclusive job descriptions. Textio’s Augmented Writing Platform, for example, assesses a company’s existing job description and offers suggestions as to how to improve their inclusivity. The<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unbiasify/affijhegklbkdinpepgphhlgphnhbenk"> Unbiasify Chrome Extension</a> similarly helps recruiters reduce bias. This free extension allows recruiters to toggle off photos and names from various talent pool sites such as LinkedIn to mitigate unconscious bias. The implications of this are compelling.</p>
<h2><strong>Increasing Your Engagement</strong></h2>
<p>Chatbots have quickly infiltrated businesses. After providing their potential to drastically enhance relationships between consumers and businesses, chatbots foraged into the recruiting domain. This can be seen in the AI recruitment platform<a href="https://mya.com/"> Mya</a>. Mya automates up to 75% of the recruiting process by answering candidates’ questions, updating applicants and verifying qualifications throughout the hiring process. Applicants who engage with Mya have been to be more than three times more likely to hear back from a hiring manager or a recruiter.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>However, chatbots are not the only manifestation of AI’s ability to engage candidates. It has the potential to help recruiters personalise employee value propositions (EVPs). The majority have only one version of their EVP that they rely on as part of their recruiting outreach efforts. This won’t appeal to all candidates. With AI, companies can analyse thousands to millions of data points that provide insights on a candidates’ persona and construct compelling personalised EVPs that engage them in new ways.</p>
<p>The retention and hiring of top talent is the lifeblood of all successful companies. AI can be game-changing in terms of empowering recruiters to reach new and more lucrative candidates and engaging with them in unprecedented ways. However, only 56% of candidates believe AI is less biased than human recruiters. AI cannot be adopted in a black-box. The effectiveness of AI-powered recruitment tech should be constantly evaluated. Chatbots should only be used in the initial stages of the recruitment journey and should not be leveraged in the closing stages when authentic human relationships are essential. The human element should never be overlooked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we face the tough challenges that come with our wellbeing in the workplace or working from home, we have found that some of these tools for managing our mental health and stress levels to be helpful.</p>
<p>If you are working in the charity sector, it is a rewarding sector that unites people with a passion for people and progress. However, we understand that you face challenges at work that affects your wellbeing. The healthcare and charity sectors face specific challenges, especially with the uncertain times that we are currently in. Charity and healthcare workers face major deadlines, the need for accountability and keen regulations which can induce stress and impact your mental health. A significant source of stress is money as the NHS and charities are largely dependent on donations, government funding and raising their own revenue. The threat of dwindling funding and cuts can add to the issue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2602" style="width: 712px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-2602 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712.jpg?_t=1587372858" alt="" width="712" height="399" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712.jpg 712w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/031920-Telemed-712-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Mental Health First</strong></h2>
<p>The significance of focusing on your mental health is gaining ground in discussions in the workplace. Healthcare and charity staff are emotionally invested in their jobs but don’t always have the support network that is needed. Putting self-care first is essential for employees, service users and the organisations themselves. It is all well and good putting your all into it, but burning out is not good for you as an individual, and this is not good for the organisations or the people that are using the organisations.</p>
<p>There are challenges that are distinct in managing self-care for managers and directors in the charity and healthcare sectors. Whether facing bereavement in cancer patients, helping survivors of domestic abuse or supporting vulnerable refugees, the healthcare and charity sector staff face distressing and traumatic situations regularly as part of their daily working life. The tendency for the healthcare and charity sectors to depend on part-time staff, volunteers and teammates working remotely also raises wellbeing issues.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Cloud Nine Online</strong></h2>
<p>As the health sector works to boost mental health, we find trends that start to emerge. With our busy lives that are hyper connected, there are digital tools and products that we can make use of to help. You can start by using search engines like Google to find information on websites like <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a> or the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> website for accurate information. You can reach out and connect with people going through the same thing through online communities, like <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/support-community-elefriends/">Elefriends</a> too. They are sometimes described as online <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information/peer-support/peer-support-directory">peer support</a>. You can also find therapy is available online, too.</p>
<p>Although social media is known to exacerbate feeling low or the need to compete with the ‘perfect’ lives posted by other people, it can help you to feel better, tools. As social media is a bit of a free-for-all, try to be careful and take care of yourself by limiting time or exposure. Connecting with friends and family through social media can aid your wellbeing.</p>
<p>Vlogs, blogs and podcasts also help people connect. You can find this content on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://bloginstructions.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogspot</a> and YouTube. Watching or reading other people’s experiences can create solidarity and provide reflection in your own feelings. Get your creative juices flowing and create your own vlogs, podcasts or vlogs during lockdown and turn off the comments to avoid negativity.</p>
<h2><strong>In the UK specifically,</strong> <strong>the </strong><a href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/HEE-Topol-Review-Mental-health-paper.pdf"><strong>Topol Review</strong></a><strong> noted several key tech solutions that are poised to impact the charity and healthcare sector for the next 20 years:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Remote Consultations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Remote consultations are having a profound impact on mental health provisions. Telehealth services allow practitioners to increase capacity and improve access to service for patients that might be in logistically or geographically underserved communities. Offering remote services improves the convenience for patients increasing the likelihood of them accessing appropriate services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Sensors/wearables</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to monitor patients and generate data relating to their conditions and activity is becoming more widespread across the healthcare sector. Continuous, real-time monitoring activity, stress levels, sleep patterns, heart rate etc. provides a much more detailed picture of people’s overall lifestyle. As these devices become more sophisticated, they are providing the ability to more accurately identify risk factors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2603 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured-1024x681.jpg?_t=1587372932" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured-768x511.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured-1200x798.jpg 1200w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ElderlySensors-ContentFeatured.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Digital therapies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mental health represents a huge growth market for digital therapeutics. Already the profession has access to some of the most evidenced therapeutic programs provided through digital channels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; Electronic health records (EHRs)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>EHRs support mental health practitioners across so many aspects of care. The ability to accurately document patient conditions, progression, efficient treatment and progression. These systems also enable data-driven decision making, consistency, ensuring quality across care pathways.</p>
<h2><strong>Big data and Machine Learning </strong></h2>
<p>The rise of analytics and big data across all industries are offering increasingly accurate patterns and trends, and the charity sector and mental health is no exception. The correct analysis of data and large pools such as online searches can offer valuable insights into data trends that can impact the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.</p>
<p>Examples of organisations that are making use of this are the <a href="https://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/"><strong>Black Dog Institute</strong></a> who are leading the way for health research in Australia. The idea is that by analysing data from sources that individuals use in daily life like social media and blogging, it will identify possible individuals who are showing signs of mental illness. By profiling these social media interactions, identifiers and new markers of mental health may provide invaluable real-time insights into mental health patterns that have the potential to revolutionise prevention and treatment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The major issues that are facing the construction industry are quality control, project efficiency and information management. So, the question is: How can digital products in the construction industry help address these key challenges?</p>
<h2><strong>Paperless Processes</strong></h2>
<p>Approximately 50 to 80% of problems on construction sites can be attributed to delayed or missing information. Project managers in the industry are using construction apps to combat this problem. With an app, you have a centralised system which can be assessed by multiple users from a variety of devices.</p>
<p>All important information can be stored in the software and have one centralised system which can be accessed by multiple users from a variety of devices. This can be updated in real time for any users that are connected to the devices. This paperless process also gives you a searchable audit trail. This will speed up your tracking information and retrieving past communication for accountability.</p>
<p>Many construction companies have a significant amount of field or mobile workers, many of those are already taking advantage of PM applications. Using these digital products, you and your team can work on-site with offline access and get instant updates as soon as you are able to reconnect to the internet. Using this system means no duplicate documents and stops your employees wasting time by chasing information from your clients. Construction management apps will increase your employees’ productivity and make organisation easier.</p>
<h2><strong>Smart Construction</strong></h2>
<p>Over a third of costs in construction projects are due to material waste and remedial work. The demand for efficiency has grown significantly because of this. With construction software that is updated in real-time, you can more efficiently organise your projects.</p>
<p><strong>Logs, Site Diaries and Permits</strong></p>
<p>Digital diaries are easily-shared, synchronised and have notifications or links to reminders. Using an app, you can easily search and share through site logs and project checklists. Because PM apps integrate with logs and digital diaries, you can quickly respond to any delays and re-schedule these tasks.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2589 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/two-man-holding-white-paper-1216589-1024x683.jpg?_t=1585826932" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/two-man-holding-white-paper-1216589-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/two-man-holding-white-paper-1216589-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/two-man-holding-white-paper-1216589-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/two-man-holding-white-paper-1216589-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>BIM</strong></h2>
<p>Since the introduction of BIM, its increase in popularity with 54% of construction professionals using BIM on at least some of their projects. Having access to your BIM files, on-site lets you and your team locate, track and resolve any on-site issues effectively.</p>
<h2><strong>Hazard &amp; Defects Observations</strong></h2>
<p>When snagging hazards or defects, workers need to keep track of a significant amount of data. Your team will often have to issue an item number and list a note of the date or location of the issue. Management of construction site software will automate the snagging and speed up the process significantly. For example, a mobile app will automatically keep track of details such as geolocation, item number and date. Your workers will be able to quickly snap pictures of the problem and upload them to the relevant record. Any relevant files are then automatically uploaded and instantly accessible by other workers.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Measures, Compliance and Project Security</strong></p>
<p>By using a construction app, you can choose the required fields on reports and forms. This is great for organisation purposes, but it also reduced the chance of any on-site issues regarding safety. An app ensures all the necessary information is easily available so the relevant personnel can act quickly to solve the problem. This greatly reduces the risk of accident or injury by speeding up the safety process.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of a cloud-based system is knowing that all your data is backed up securely. You can customise access to specific screens based on the role of your employee. If necessary, you can also set up security measures such as a 2-step verification for projects with strict requirements for compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting, Analytics and Big Data</strong></p>
<p>Digital workflows give you real-time data for reporting and analysis. You can use this data to visualise your progress in graphs, tables and dashboards. You forecast costs, track tasks and quickly identify areas where you need to act. You will also have access to advanced reporting where you can monitor employee performance and find new ways to increase efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>It is a given that you can save money by monitoring data through software. By closely watching your data metrics, you can identify areas that are a major drain on your finances. For example: Let’s say the data shows that workers are often just standing waiting for a specific item to arrive to begin work. This means that you’re paying a lot for man hours that aren’t being used to get work done which is a financial drain on the project.</p>
<p>While it may seem counterintuitive to shell out money on construction management software to save money, that’s exactly what software can help you do. Construction software can help you become more organized, which keeps you on schedule and on budget.</p>

<p>The biggest challenges that we face today will require all of us to take action, no matter what sector we work in. People may ask why companies in 2020 should be bothered with sustainability as it would be their main focus to make money. However, we should not underestimate the power of consumers in 2020. Today, consumers have access to more information and data than ever before. They are well-educated on what they want and what they are passionate about and they know how to get it quickly. However, we have seen a shift in the criteria that consumers are looking at when it comes to digital products. There are a growing number of consumers that are not making a decision on price anymore. They are looking closely into brand representation and what they stand for.</p>
<p>This also goes for employees. Employees are taking care to join companies that align with their values which adds an additional layer to the employment process and employee retention. They are choosing companies that align with their ethos on the environment specifically. Simply, companies will not succeed long term unless they make a positive contribution to society as a whole.</p>

<p>Our CEO at Borne addressed this in his article on <a href="https://borneagency.com/blogs/digital-transformation-an-inside-out-approach/">Digital Transformation</a>, this shift in tech and how it is affecting every sector. These changes are altering the world around us so quickly that all companies have to undergo a transformation to avoid complete extinction. This transformation means the integration of digital products into all areas of your business  will change how you deliver your digital product to your customer. Digitalisation and tech will help a business achieve this and maintain a highly agile process. However, transformation is also about a change of culture which requires a radical change of thinking. Just like any company cannot survive without digital transformation, this will require a human element of change too.  While tech itself does come with its own environmental cost, digitalisation and tech plays a crucial role in developing solutions for a sustainable future.</p>
<p>An example of this, Google is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning which allows the company to focus on consuming less energy, reduce emissions and cut energy bills. The DeepMind term at Google have used AI to reduce the amount of energy for cooling their data centres by 40%. They are also making use of machine-learning algorithms to harness wind power by predicting wind output 36 hours in advance and delivering optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid. Google have released a statement saying, &#8220;machine learning has boosted the value of our wind energy by roughly 20%, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based commitments to the grid.&#8221;</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this sounds amazing, it needs a lot of transformation. Transformation inside companies by integrating digital technology and products into all areas of your business. Transformation of a company&#8217;s internal culture, with the leaders setting the tone of a company, embracing necessary change towards sustainable ethics. On the larger scale, industries are unpredictable. If we want to create a world where sustainability is an effortless part of everyday life, we should look beyond the corporate boundary and towards the communities you create in your business. In the end, transformation will succeed or fail because of people and the initiatives we take with the resources we have. It is up to us to use the technological advancements that come to tackle the world&#8217;s greatest challenges towards sustainability.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software is a driving force in pushing improvements in the healthcare sector over the past few years. From improving diagnosis to treating ailments and identifying social determinants of health, software has become the way forward going into 2020.</p>
<p>While these changes are amazing in improving overall quality of life, these advancements to not come without a price. Health tech, as it should, has strict data compliance that we as product designers and developers need to comply to as there is sensitive data involved. In 2018, the Data Protection Act was instated to update data protection laws in the UK which complements the European Data Protection Regulation. This is similar to the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) which is a United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. Whether you or your company have been asked to build a product for a pharmaceutical company, hospital systems or the NHS and biotech companies, we have made sure to put measures in place in order to comply with the compliance standards put in place and improve the outcome for patience and users overall.</p>
<p>Over time, we have noticed that a number of developers have joined or are planning on building products in the health tech realm in order to make a positive impact for clients and patients. We at Borne have worked with companies in the health tech sector. Here are words of advice we would give developers that are planning of building health tech products and are not sure where to start:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-2514 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photo-1453060113865-968cea1ad53a-1024x537.jpg?_t=1576666394" alt="" width="840" height="441" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photo-1453060113865-968cea1ad53a-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photo-1453060113865-968cea1ad53a-300x157.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photo-1453060113865-968cea1ad53a-768x403.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photo-1453060113865-968cea1ad53a-1200x629.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><br />
HIPAA 2b²</strong></h2>
<p>If you are a developer in health tech, you would have heard about HIPAA and GDPR compliance. Compliance with both ensures that your software systems and equipment which contains sensitive healthcare information are carefully monitored and controlled, with access to this information is limited to a set number of authorised individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Things you need to be aware of are:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Data being disposed of improperly, stolen, lost or not accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Hackers compromising data</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Data disclosure without authorisation from the patient</p>
<p>Data protection under GDPR and HIPAA requires knowledge of both non-technical and technical concerns. On the non-technical side, you would need to take new staff on-boarding requirements, incident reporting protocols and password policies that you would need to take into account. On the technical side, you may encounter technical infrastructure requirements and penetration testing to ensure safeguards are adequately put in place.</p>
<p>It is important that employees at every level of the organisation that you work for maintain awareness of phishing scams and ransomware. Emails are disguised as internal comms asking for sensitive information such as passwords or logins that would cause people to click on links that would install this malware. Keep this in mind when you are building and adapting systems so you are always aware of this and prepared for these situations. It is important to remember that GDPR and HIPAA are not temporary checkboxes that you need to tick. They are an protocols that are ongoing that requires maintenance as it is constantly evolving.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2515" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/life-health-clinical-hospital-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/life-health-clinical-hospital-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/life-health-clinical-hospital-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/life-health-clinical-hospital.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Your Users are People Too </strong></h2>
<p>It is important to remember that your users of the product are people too. This may seem obvious, but this is particularly important that health-tech end-users are humans that may be particularly vulnerable or in vulnerable situations. Whether your systems that are in development is a program that is in use in a doctor&#8217;s office, or your system is powering the machinery that their lives depend on, you are building for a population that may be more likely to have disabilities or be less familiar with tech overall.</p>
<p>With the nature of the product, it is likely that the user did not choose the software that you are building as it was provided to them. For this reason alone, practicing user empathy is vital while building your product. You also need to take accessibility into account during development. If you structure high-quality accessibility standards into the development and design sprints which can set things up for a broad user-base. This is especially important for people that may have motor or visual importance or may have the need for voice tech to access the system you are building.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should come as no surprise that construction mobile apps are shifting the way modern construction projects are completed. Mobile apps assist construction companies of various sizes and to maintain efficiency and cost effectiveness. You can assume that nowadays, most contractors use standard tech like smartphones, laptops and tablets while they are on location for a project. A survey conducted in the US showed that a total of 72% of people working in the construction sector use their smartphones on the job.</p>
<p>Apps that are available in the construction genre help managers and workers stick to their strict schedules by streamlining paperwork and improving coordination and communication. The adoption of cloud tech and mobile apps is being utilised by a larger scope of construction professionals that are making use of digital products to keep track of issue status and mitigate risk spanning their project portfolios with one central mobile platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Here’s a list of 5 ways that construction mobile apps are transforming the construction sector:</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Reduction of Delays</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the commercial construction sector, reworking and delays can cost millions of pounds in lost revenue which will negatively affect the company’s reputation. As with anything, especially in the UK, weather conditions are unpredictable so cannot plan accurately for licensing red-tape and permits. However, managers can sync and organise their operational activities via construction mobile delivery apps to optimise their schedules.</p>
<p>Let’s say a construction manager in charge of various job sites can monitor progress at multiple jobs sites and can allocate materials to all the job sites in real-time. By receiving this information in real-time from multiple job sites through mobile apps, this can reduce delays in the construction process, incidents and overall project delays. This help to bring issues to the surface that may occur and keep the construction schedule on track.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Safety Compliance Awareness and Management</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With nearly 6.5 million people that work at approximately   252,000 construction sites across the UK, the fatal injury statistics in the construction sector are higher than the national average. These numbers may not apply to the scale of many companies, however the chances of construction companies managing multiple job sites are high. And with this comes the massive responsibility of managing the safety of employees. Having a customised app that includes daily safety checklists would make it easier to manage and mitigate risk, keeping jobsites streamlined and safe. Making use of digital products on site allows for on-site safety compliance instant at-risk observations on your mobile device and serve as an official record of the project. This means double data entries are a thing of the past thus improving and strengthening regulatory compliance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Flexibility and Accuracy in Project Documentation</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile apps provide the ability to customise documentation and create reports in the field, unlike paper forms. All projects are different, so if you can create defect capture forms specific to your project eliminates repetitive and error-prone processes. Real-time reporting provides the ability for workers to create more detailed reports as they encounter issues as opposed to filling out forms once they return to the office. Construction mobile apps can capture information at the job site which improves accuracy and reduces potential issues that may arise from logistics such as inconsistent data, illegible handwriting and gaps in information.</p>
<p>Additional documentation and daily reports in the field can utilise time stamps, GPS tracking and the ability to capture signatures in real-time. The accuracy of this methods in capturing information creates accountability for clients and an indisputable audit trail for the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Field Accountability</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>The back office, without the input of mobile tech, has little insight into what is going on in the field. This may create a culture with a lack of accountability. Mobile tech has GPS capabilities which lets project managers to track time spent on-site, as well as maintaining accurate time cards which will save on labour costs. Another benefit to integrating the construction sector with digital products can with tracking and managing on-site equipment which can improve inventory use and planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Improve Communication</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile construction tech can give you a better mode of communication with all company employees. The ability to communicate with on-site workers, the office and additional employees in an efficient and streamlined approach improves overall operations. Mobile construction tech gives employees the ability to communicate efficiently and quickly so that they can receive real-time responses on site that can be documented. Whether it is reducing delays, increasing accountability in the field, ensuring on-site safety compliance, improving communication or improving accuracy and flexibility, there is an opportunity to build digital products for the construction sector to support any business requirement. Identifying and implementing these products could serve as the backbone for greater productivity and growth in the future.</p>
