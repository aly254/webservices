				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to product development, the iterative process is designed specifically to help teas ship out your product as quickly as possible by actively reducing the initial complexity of features and functionality. This is valuable because it gets the product in the hands of users sooner, allowing our team at Borne to validate quickly whether the product needs to be adapted in any way. Another approach to this is the waterfall approach, which asks teams to build in all the complexity upfront and then put the product in front of customers which is much riskier and a potentially costlier outcome.</p>
<p>Our team uses iterative product development achieves its speed through a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach. MVP means taking the possible feature set that could be included in a product, or the possible functionality a specific feature could deliver, and cutting that down to the minimum needed to bring value to the end user. A great example of this would be reworking the first music streaming app, like iTunes or Spotify. It could have many different potential features beyond music streaming. Features like playlists, recommendations, search following artists etc.  Once the MVP of a product is live, our team can the quickly assess if it’s successful or not, and with minimum time invested, can move rapidly to build on the initial functionality. It is this step of the process where things can start to go sideways. The issue may start with the concept of the MVP. We aren’t geared to think in terms of MVP. In fact, our mind may take the opposite approach. When we get excited about an idea, our brain goes wild with all the possibilities. We imagine all the possible value a product could deliver and then we lose a significant portion of that value by cutting it down to the bare minimum. Even if your MVP is successful, you tend to feel a loss rather than a gain.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2667 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_6460.jpg?_t=1591606571" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_6460.jpg 750w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_6460-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Running Before You Can Walk</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The MVP process is primed to regain the value you think you’ve lost. As soon as the product is live, we fall into an additive strategy where we are compelled to add new functionality to win back the ‘lost’ value.</p>
<p>This ‘weakness’ based mind-set gets further reinforced when we start analysing data and feedback. Because loss aversion causes us to focus on losses more than gains, we are more likely to gloss over positive signals and areas of strength and focus instead on the areas of the product that “aren’t working”. Think about the amount of effort you put into understanding why something is not working versus the effort you apply to understanding why something is working.</p>
<p>We should consider the amount of effort you put into understanding why something isn’t working versus the effort you apply to understand why something is working. It is rare to hear someone say, “how do we double down on this feature that is working?” Rather, we strive to deliver value by fixing what we perceive to be broken or missing. If you go back to the music streaming app example, if you believed that a playlist was a crucial feature but it was cut in the MVP, you are priming yourself to put a higher weight on any feedback where a user complains about not having a playlist because it validates your own sense of lost value. Even if that feedback goes against other signals you are receiving.</p>
<p>We focus on areas of weakness because they represent potentially lost value, but weakness-based product development is like swimming upstream. Areas of strength are signals from your users about where they see value in your product. When we focus on areas of weakness in the product, we are effectively ignoring those signals, often working against our existing behaviour to ‘improve’ your engagement by forcing some new value. So, many product updates only garner incremental improvement. Just keep swimming upstream.</p>
<p><strong>Shifting Your Mind-Set</strong></p>
<p>When you find yourself in a weakness-based mind-set in the development of your product, it can be difficult to shift your way of thinking. Here’s what we suggest shifting your approach to your product:</p>
<p><strong>Ask the question: “What works in your product?”</strong></p>
<p>When you observe areas of strength during the development, we shouldn’t just give ourselves a pat on the back and move on from it. We should make those areas the key focus of the next phase in development. We should be the ones to ask, why is this working and how can we accelerate this feature? We should stop chasing the new value. You are already delivering value and we build on that.</p>
<p><strong> Shifting from an addition approach to subtraction approach</strong></p>
<p>When you look at metrics, stop looking at weak performance as something to be improved. Instead, look at it first as an opportunity to simplify. Instead of immediately asking,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“How can we make this better? Make the first question, is this something we should get rid of completely?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is especially powerful in existing products. If you’ve been practicing weakness-based development you potentially have a bloated, underused feature set that’s dragging down your overall experience. What if every third or fourth development cycle you didn’t build anything new and instead focused on what you were going to get rid of? How quickly would that streamline your product and bring you back to your core strengths?</p>
<p>We get worried about upsetting users who have adopted features that aren’t driving our success. This should be considered a normal part of the process. Users will readjust, and yes, some might leave. But if you are clear on your product’s strengths and focus your efforts there, the value you gain will more than make up for anything you lose by cutting the things that are holding you back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, product design or UX design is a crucial component in the making of mobile apps and websites. As you already know, design matters. As such, UX design helps to turn a simple idea into a beautiful, stunning and useful digital product. Thanks to UX design, users are able to return and use brands and their digital products over and over again.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you are a <a href="http://borneagency.com">mobile app developer</a>, program manager, product manager, project manager, marketing manager or a general user, it is important to understand UX design. In this article, we will focus on what is UX design, how UX design influences digital apps and product design. Also, we will touch on how UX designers can achieve user acquisition and retention.</p>
<p><strong>What is UX design?</strong></p>
<p>This is a creative and elaborate process where professionals identify a market opportunity, define the problem and create a solution for the problem(s). Also referred to as product design, it is the creation of digital products that enhance user experience.</p>
<p>The process involves the design of digital products such as mobile apps, includes aspects of design usability, functionality, and branding among others.</p>
<p><strong>Ways UX designers influence digital apps and product design</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Create digital solutions that support and enhance human interactions</em></p>
<p>UX designers contribute in numerous fields with one goal in mind, to enhance the experience of users as they interact with digital products. By doing this, they help to enhance growth and development among the people.</p>
<p>How are they able to achieve this? Working as a team, they create flows of layouts and interactions for health care, e-commerce, and education among others. These apps are applied in the fields above to offer tips, solutions, knowledge and technical support among others.</p>
<p>All of them help to influence how the final digital product will appear and function.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>Product research is a critical step in UX design. It allows the team to get feedback on what users are looking for. It also enables the team to learn what competitors have released in the market. Finally, it allows the team of designers to learn what aspects need to be improved in order to beat the competitors, attract users and retain them as well.</p>
<p>How should UX designers conduct research? Through user interviews, through online surveys, through competitive research, and through contextual inquiry. To ensure research is successful, plan your questions, find an experienced interviewer, keep it short and include both open-ended and closed-ended questions.</p>
<p>The team of designers and analysts should carry out meaningful research before settling on a certain design. As you already know, time spent during research is never wasted. It goes a long way in improving current and future products too. This helps the team save money, time and a lot of resources. As such, selling your ideas to other clients is easier. Here at Borne, we work with several UX tools that allow us to track user behaviour and consumer interactions that allow us to best design for the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>User analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data gathered from research needs to be analyzed in order to make sense. Through user analysis, the team is able to draw insights. Basically, they are able to capture, organize and make inferences about the users&#8217; needs which helps UX designers to come with the best digital products for the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to user analysis, the team identifies key user groups. Using this infor</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2385" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="291" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg 598w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 85vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>mation, they are able to create personas. These personas are fictional characters that help UX designers to figure out how users might use a digital product. Thanks to the creation of personas, UX designers understand the user&#8217;s goals. This is useful in ideation.</p>
<p>Designers should base the personas on real data. They should avoid using real names of people they know. Apart from personas, designers should create an empathy map, a tool that helps the team understand what users’ want and need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consider the why, what and how of product use</strong></p>
<p>Before embarking on a project, UX designers always consider the why, what and how of product use. The “Why” is all about product adoption by the masses. How they relate to tasks they want to perform and the views associated with the use of the product.</p>
<p>The “What” is all about functionality &#8211; things users will do with the final digital product. Will they use the digital product to learn, to gain knowledge, to collaborate, to entertain or manage everyday tasks?</p>
<p>Finally, we have the “How.” This encompasses the design of functionality. By this we mean, the designer should focus on how accessible and aesthetic the digital product will be.</p>
<p>In product design, UX designers always begin with the “Why” before embarking on the “What” and the “How.” By following this process, the team is able to create aesthetically pleasing and functioning digital solutions that offer meaningful experiences. Basically, the designers should ensure that the app, software, and website offers a fluid experience.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve actual problems</strong></p>
<p>There are tons of problems that digital solutions can solve. For instance, we need apps, websites, and blogs to disseminate information and news to the masses. To organize our daily schedules, we need to do list apps, calendar apps and note taking apps. When it comes to shopping for products, we need e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Finally, we have entertainment. Without apps and websites that enable us to stream, music, games, and videos, life would be dull.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. We need apps that allow us to do even simple things like keep time. To enhance usability and accessibility, UX design helps in the creation of aesthetic and intuitive interfaces and navigation. To achieve this, designers and mobile app designers spend hours building these products.</p>
<p><strong>Convert simple operations into intuitive and aesthetic pleasing to the human eye</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A lot of people imagine that UX design is all about dragging and dropping elements such as buttons, menus, color, and other elements. Yes, part of UX design is creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces for digital solutions. The other major part is largely about planning, research, analysis, and collaboration.</p>
<p>A vast majority of designers have been trained in internationally recognized institutions while others are self-taught. Thanks to the knowledge gained over a number of years, UX designers are proficient in combining beauty and functionality. And that is how they add value to digital solutions such as software, mobile apps, blogs, and websites.</p>
<p><strong>User Engagement and Retention in UX Design -How to Achieve It</strong></p>
<p>Upcoming designers always imagine that to attract and retain users on a mobile app, website, software or blog, the interface should be pretty. Well, that is not always the case. Take a website like Reddit. Even today when popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Material design feature on hundreds of blogs and websites, people still visit Reddit. Why? Simple layouts are still attractive.</p>
<p>So, what is the secret to user engagement in UX design? It is the experience itself. Users want to interact with an app or web platform on a simpler level. Yes, designers can incorporate colours, buttons, graphs, and menus but at the end of the day, what they want is to move from one page to the next with ease.</p>
<p>So, how can UX designers encourage user engagement? Here are a few techniques to achieve this</p>
<p><strong>Use of UX Animation</strong></p>
<p>Today, 2D animation plays a critical role in UX design. How? Diff<a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif"><img class="wp-image-2384 alignright" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif" alt="" width="369" height="277" /></a>erent animations can be created to elicit a particular behaviour. For instance, when a user hovers over a button, it can change colour say from red to green to show its clickable. Another example is error messages. They can pop up on a screen and shake. This helps to draw the attention of the user. So, to ensure user engagement, UX designers should create realistic animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simply the interface design</strong></p>
<p>As a UX designer, what you need to know is that users hate jumping through hoops when interacting with your mobile app, blog, software or website. People are interested in the final result. To achieve this, they need to use the quickest and simplest method. That means when designing, you should build UX flowcharts for every page especially when sketching wireframes. Imagine this, your website or mobile app requires users to sign up. If locating the sign-up page is difficult, they will opt to use other apps that offer a better experience. To simplify your digital products, start researching UX designs.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>
<p>The success of any digital product today and in the future will depend on better UX design. If you would like to find our more about how we employ design thinking and usability research into shaping our design decisions then <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact">get in touch. </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1149" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Browse-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>

<p>We are so happy to announce that Streats is now live on the App Store! Download to discover the best street food in London and please let us know what you think. It&#8221;s been a great journey for the Streats team, and it&#8217;s only just beginning!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the days when glasses were for people with bad eyesight or to shield our eyes from the sun? No? Us neither.</p>
<p>Snapchat (who have now rebranded themselves as &#8216;Snap. Inc&#8217;) have announced that they will be releasing a pair of sunglasses with a twist&#8230;they have an in-built camera. We don&#8217;t blame them for trying something a little &#8216;out there&#8217; after <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/instagram-stories/">Instagram essentially stole their best feature</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Snap Spectacles&#8217; contain a video-camera that records footage and can be posted to users&#8217; snapchat stories via the &#8216;memories&#8217; function. Users activate the camera by tapping a button in top left-hand corner of the glasses. The camera will then capture 10 seconds of video, storing it in the specs until it is transferred to the users smartphone.</p>
<p>And for those of you who feel unsettled by the thought of someone filming you via their sunglasses (so, everyone), fear not. Snap Specs have an outward facing light that is activated once the camera is switched on.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What about Google Glass?</span></p>
<p>Google was the last company to attempt a pair of video-camera spectacles, and it&#8217;s safe to say it didn&#8217;t exactly go down well. Google said &#8220;this is the future!&#8221; and the world said &#8220;no&#8221;. The wearable lasted 2 years before it seemed even Google admitted they simply weren&#8217;t for the masses.</p>
<p>Google Glass faced heavy criticism, The product was viewed as invasive, weird-looking and borderline creepy. Of course, there were also safety concerns. Drivers were becoming distracted by the tiny screen on the side of their glasses. Oh, and users were labelled &#8216;glassholes&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Prince Charles doing his bit for Google Glass&#8217; street cred&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/what-a-glasshole.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-478 size-medium" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/what-a-glasshole-210x300.jpg" alt="mobile app developers" width="210" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>They also cost a whopping $1500.</p>
<p>But will Snap Spec&#8217;s share the same fate? Whilst the specs may struggle to achieve long lasting superstardom, as other companies battle to get in on the action, we think this product might just have the edge.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They&#8217;re fun</span></p>
<p>Evan Spiegel himself called them a &#8216;toy&#8217;. The glasses are fun, they&#8217;re bright, they&#8217;re quirky. They&#8217;re a bit of a joke. And we mean a funny joke, not an awkward joke like Google Glass.</p>
<p>Essentially, Snap Specs could succeed because they don&#8217;t take themselves too seriously. They&#8217;re not trying to do too much. Spiegel has struck the balance between a serious piece of technology, and a techie toy for social-media addicted teenagers.</p>
<p><u>Snapchat&#8217;s existing userbase</u></p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s existing userbase are predominantly young, sociable, smartphone-enthusiasts. Supposedly 9000 snaps are shared on Snapchat every second, that&#8217;s a lot of snapping. People <em>love </em>posting on Snapchat. It&#8217;s more <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/is-facebook-growing-old/">private than Facebook</a>, and more fun than Instagram. Oh, and there&#8217;s little chance of your Nan adding you.</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s huge userbase could do wonders for the Specs when they launch. Whilst Google Glass was seen as creepy, Snapchat&#8217;s notably younger target demographic conjures images of teenagers snapping their friends in the sun, as opposed to people on the street in oversized, beige anoraks talking to strangely futuristic see-through strips across their eyes.</p>
<p>Whilst other wearable tech has generally been marketed towards wealthy professionals or fitness enthusiasts (and has been met with a decidedly &#8216;meh&#8217; response), Snapchat&#8217;s users are already used to sharing a large portion of their lives online and with followers. Combine social media with an actual fashion accessory, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a winner.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affordable</span></p>
<p>The specs cost $130, which is definitely at the lower end in terms of wearable technology. And as actual sunglasses? They cost less than the average pair of Raybans. With it&#8217;s built-in camera that links to social media, we think the price is unlikely to deter the determined youths of 2016.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They&#8217;re kind of cool&#8230;</span></p>
<p>We say &#8216;cool&#8217;, but what we mean is &#8216;weird-looking-in-a-good-way&#8217; which seems to be the thing nowadays. I mean, you wouldn&#8217;t catch me wearing them on a sunny day but we could well see hundreds of teenagers sporting the specs at the latest festival to hit the Great British countryside.</p>
<p>The specs are available in black, coral or teal. They&#8217;re bright and bold &#8211; they&#8217;re a hipster&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are more &#8216;Go-Pro&#8217; than &#8216;computer&#8217;</span></p>
<p>Whilst Google Glass faced criticism for distracting drivers and making conversations awkward as users were often focusing on the teeny-weeny in-built computer, Snap Specs seem to be going in a different direction.</p>
<p>They are not &#8216;smartglasses&#8217;. Instead, they are to be seen as a more convenient, less extreme, Go-Pro. They&#8217;re techie in a far less serious way than Google Glass was. The promotional video shows a group of happy millennials enjoying the summer and snapping their activities with ease.</p>
<p>Despite the privacy concerns that will no doubt sweep the population, we think, if used correctly, Snap Specs are a great start for Snapchat for their expansion into wearable tech.</p>
<p>Hats off to Snapchat for raising the bar in wearables, creating a product that doesn&#8217;t constantly track and analyse our every move. Instead, Snap Specs are a way for users to enjoy and share fun experiences in the sun with their friends, without having to use their smartphones.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sure it won&#8217;t be long before Instagram does something similar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry-content">
<p>This morning luxury watch manufacturer Tag Heuer unveiled its first foray into the smartphone market at an event in New York. The device, billed as a luxury smart watch is called the Carrera Connected and will retail at around $1500 so expect a price of around £1,000 when it hits stores in London and the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The watch which has been created with the involvement of Google and Intel has been designed to make the watch ‘not look like a connected watch’ according to the company and, while obviously on the pricier side of smart watches, fits in well for a demographic who want the benefits of a smart watch without the ‘tech’ badge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But what does it do?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Apple alerted users in an ‘all guns blazing’ style when unveiling the Apple Watch earlier in the year Tag Heuer has been considerably more understated. In fact, there is little to no reference the ‘smart’ portion of the watch in its promo video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile app developers will be pleased to know that because the device is based on Android wear the app arsenal of the Google Store will be fully available for the Tag Heuer device and there may well be new applications built to suit the demographic at the higher end of the smart watch market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tag Heuer has not exactly focused on the smart side of the watch, likely leaving this to Intel and Google, which is understandable as the Swiss Manufacturer’s CEO Jean-Claude Biver commented on the watch as a ‘marriage’ between the luxury Swiss world of watches and Silicon Valley. This may be the first of such ‘marriages’ but we can expect more in the coming months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this does is open the smart watch bracket to more traditional watch wearers who admire the style in a traditional sense above the tech. The watch comes with just three faces which can be downloaded via the Google Play store and it has clearly been designed to resemble a watch with tech features rather than a smartphone masquerading as a watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expect features such as fitness apps, travel alerts and message alerts to be popular in keeping with the established smart watch norm but we will be some time off established whether users of different smart watch brands have vastly different app uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An Apple Challenger?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Apple nailing down its own infrastructure the market for smart watches on Android is wide open and it really is too early to see whether there is a clear leader for Android Wear devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, it is good to see that such an iconic market leader like Tag Heuer has taken up the mantle of luxury smart watch and has been able to work closely with partners like Google and Intel to see its goal become a reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more and more traditional watch manufacturers expand their reach into the smart watch world we will likely see a shift in focus of both industries with new and innovative apps for smart watches developed and a change in the way watch manufacturers operate including their target market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not quite be Brave New World territory but it is an exciting one nonetheless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At yesterday’s Oculus Connect Conference the news we have been waiting for finally arrived. The launch date of the much vaunted Oculus Rift headset has been announced, sort of. The firm, which is owned by Facebook, has given a projected Q4 release of the VR headsets that are poised to change the way we view entertainment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at the Rift, see what it can do and whether it can create the impact it hopes it will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Over-hyped or worth the wait?</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VR headsets are nothing new. They have been tried and failed before. Even 3D TV in your own living room hasn’t really taken off so why does Oculus think it can be any different? It’s a good question and one that is multi-faceted in its answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we turn back the clock to the 1990s and look at Nintendo and its two failed VR offerings – the Power Glove and the Virtual Boy you can see simply that the world wasn’t yet ready for VR. First of all the technology was simply too weak to have any sort of lasting impact but kudos for trying. Nintendo’s ecosystems were closed meaning that only Nintendo games would play on the systems, and only certain ones at that. There was no internet, graphics were weak and there was nowhere else for the VR technology to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe we are looking at Nintendo a little harshly and should be praising them for trying but, quite simply, the 90s was too soon for home entertainment VR technology. Fast forward 20 years and we are in a world where you can literally talk to your TV or your watch and have access to information, entertainment and graphics that are sometimes breathtakingly real.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we look too at what Facebook brings to the table we see that Oculus really does have what it takes to succeed. With Facebook you have a network of a billion people to advertise to and get excited about Oculus, all across the world. You also have a little thing called legacy. Facebook doesn’t need money first of all so it could afford to allow the Oculus team the time and the resources to get it right. There is a genuine consensus among the big players in the tech industry – your Facebook’s, Google’s and Apple’s that the internet of things is not just a cute coined phrase but a real chance to impact upon society and leave a legacy. Oculus is part of that for Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg especially. Going down in history as the founder of Facebook is one thing but going down in history as the guy who was behind physical items which change lives is another entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes Oculus Rift is an entertainment platform but its applications are potentially far reaching especially in industries like architectural design or medicine so all of the ingredients point towards Oculus Rift having a very good shot at success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Good news for Samsung fans</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other news at the event concerned Samsung Galaxy users with the announcement of the November launch of the Samsung Gear VR which has been built by Oculus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device, aimed squarely at gamers and mobile users has some good backing with Oculus and Samsung keen to learn from the past mistakes of Nintendo in terms of developer support – arcade firms Namco and Midway plus Sega have already announced their support for the system with new Oculus focused development teams already on hand to create games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gear VR unit was announced at $99 and will launch in time for the big Black Friday shopping event in the US. Expect that to translate to at least a £99 price point when released in the UK as exchange rates rarely come into consideration with tech prices but that still is a pretty decent value for the kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The support, price and the buzz may just carry this one to success with analysts projecting an astounding 30 million unit sales by 2020. It remains to be seen just how far off the mark this figure is but the low price and launch timing will at least carry large sales in its initial period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Announce Like Apple</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the main Oculus Rift device there was equally positive support with the unit expected to sell for around $300, again expect that to translate to around £300 per unit when it launches. Big players in the PC market like Dell have announced their support of the device, and Oculus is already working closely with Microsoft to be able to make Oculus work with its XBox consoles. From a TV perspective Netflix are on board as are film production companies Lionsgate and 20th Century Fox. As the device comes to market expect more announcements of support to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the event too, a developer friendly device was announced so app developers take note, and the launch of the Rift is set to happen like an Apple product which sees the launch announcement quickly followed by the chance to pre-order and full launch take place within about a month. The user experience has certainly been taken into consideration here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all it was an extremely positive event with journalists, industry insiders and the wider public as a whole all wanting this to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll put our name in that hat too and look forward to hearing more about Oculus in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>We were (digitally) at the event and take a look back and see the news that came out of it and just what that means for Apple and the rest of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Something’s got to give</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to mention about the event is what wasn’t at the event. Apple traditionally holds two end-of-year events which covers mobile, Mac and everything in between. This year marked a change to the dual format with all of Apple’s news crammed in to a single two and a half hour event. Something had to give, and it did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mac users were treated to the merest sniff of an upgrade and while Apple cannot be expected to rewrite the (Mac) book every year it nevertheless did seem disappointing that the old flagship has been relegated to the back of Apple’s mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were plenty of positives coming from the event however, but the movement to a single event inevitably means that not all of Apple’s products are going to see massive air time. The upside of that is that some products had more air time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apple release the iPhone 6s</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The iPhone 6s was launched to much fanfare with a graphics and performance boost compared with the the existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 + devices. It’s a bit unfair on Apple to question the upgrades (the devices look essentially the same) but the improvement in power and the features such as moving pictures (think gifs) don’t really suggest that the 6s will be a world beater. The devices will be released later in September at the same price point of the existing models. The improved front and back cameras do look like producing sharp images but a camera upgrade on a new phone model is pretty much a given these days. That said the new and improved iPhone 6s and 6s plus will provide iPhone 4 and 5 users with food for thought but existing 6 users will likely give it a miss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will a pencil save the iPad?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new iPad was also unveiled at the event, this time aimed at the more professional market. Aptly named the iPad Pro it is said to be “The biggest news in iPad since the iPad,” according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. iPad sales have been dropping in recent years as a combination of competition and lack of real features (what else can you do with it apart from watch films, browse the net and play games?) have resulted in fewer people upgrading devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The iPad pro then is set to position Apple a little differently in the marketplace as this is fashioned as a powerful work tool for graphic designers, illustrators and others in creative industry. The iPad pro is going to be released with an additional stylus accessory to make the tablet lightweight and functional for work as well as play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hold Wacom a minute…?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the elephant in the room is that Wacom is already established in the industry as the de facto must have tool for design creatives, and for good reason too, as it is the best. Although Wacom has been introducing more slim line and travel friendly devices recently it is ostensibly a workplace tool so Apple has a chance of fitting in with the entertainment/work sphere. It is priced well too at comfortably less than Wacom’s offerings so it may well appeal to students as well as designers needing an extra tool for travel as well as having the ability to watch a film or two.<br />
<strong>The Future of TV is Apps – TVOS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of films, Apple TV got a much needed and long overdue upgrade at the event. If any criticisms were to be made of the original Apple TV it would be lack of app support. Quite simply the device did not support enough applications to make it worthwhile as a home entertainment hub. Apple TV mark 2 is something different with tons of support in addition to better memory and performance and a remote that can be voice controlled thanks to Siri and you have a device that is a potential player in the TV market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple said that it was taking TV seriously and the new Apple TV announcement showed that this was true so you have to give Apple credit for putting their money where their mouth was so to speak.<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all it was positive steps for Apple if not great leaps which cannot be expected every time. They have gone to some lengths to alter the image of its struggling brands like the Apple TV and the iPad and diversify its brand image somewhat. It remains to be seen whether the likes of Sky or Cintiq can be challenged in their established domains but the moves are generally positive and both the TV and professional tablet, the TV especially, look like credible devices rather than the ‘Apple Toys’ they had come to be known as. The iPad and Apple TV upgrades at least give the two devices a fighting chance in their respective marketplaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this won’t be one of the more memorable Apple events it was certainly a steady and positive movement forward for the company. With Apple you always get the impression that something big is around the corner. If this was a graded paper you would give the event a steady B ‘good, but can do better’. And the thing is with Apple, you know they will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry-content">
<p>The majority of TVs bought these days are smart TVs, Video on Demand (VOD) services like Netflix and Amazon Prime are seriously threatening traditional broadcasters and their established methods and now Apple TV is poised to (re) join the party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many of us know Apple TV; it has been around for some time now and has been mostly used as a method to connect iPods or iPads to the TV screen for a larger viewing experience and, truth be told, not much more. This may well change at the next Apple Event which takes place next week and which could be a promising change in Apple TV World.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A bit like lettuce</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among Apple products Apple TV seems something like a neglected cousin or, to use a sandwich analogy (BLTs aside) a bit like lettuce. Bread and filling are important, as too is sauce and even butter or spread of some kind. Lettuce, lettuce seems to be a bit of an afterthought, much like Apple TV. Now, that is no sleight against lettuce or against Apple TV for that matter but the fact remains that until now Apple just did not believe its smart TV box was an integral part of the sandwich. Analogy over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rumours have surfaced over the weekend that Apple TV is to get something of a renewed focus from Apple, especially in the wake of the success of aforementioned VOD services offered by Netflix and Amazon. It is interesting that these rumours have arisen not long after Netflix has announced it is to remove a lot of films from its databases to concentrate on original content. It may be a case of ‘wait and see’ whether that is a coincidence or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3 Party Support</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Apple TV was not designed in the same light as a VOD service there is no reason why it could not become one, or become something more integrated a la the PlayStation Network of Xbox live (in terms of an entertainment hub, not a games platform though that would be interesting). Apple certainly has the resources and the customer base to make something of Apple TV. Let’s not forget that Apple TV has a great user base already, though its uses are somewhat limited there are already people invested in the platform and Apple TV Plus as it were could entice many of them to upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iTunes already offers a movie download service and Apple TV itself already has a core interface. A potential upgrade could see, if not a game changer, then at least a mover and shaker in the industry. Analysts, journalists and industry insiders have already pointed to the lack of 3rd party support for Apple TV as a negative and, with so much offered by built-in smart TVs the next gen TV must have something special up its sleeve to make headlines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is Apple, let’s not forget. There will be headlines even if there is not much to write about. But if Apple is serious about TV then again, there will be something to write about. While info is tentative at the moment and rumours speculate about a more powerful device with more applications and 3rd party support than the original Apple TV it remains to be seen exactly what will be revealed next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we will certainly hope that it is positive news, for more than entertainment’s sake.</p>

<h3><strong> Pencil and a sketch pad</strong></h3>
<p>Paper Wireframing is still one-way to create a beautiful and functional design for a Web app or iPhone creation.    <img class="alignright wp-image-55 size-medium" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/28-02_iphoneapp-1-300x245.jpg" alt="mobile app developers" width="300" height="245" /></p>
<p>In today’s age of concentrating on how much high tech we can use. Sometimes the old fashion ways are best.</p>
<p>For selling to a client jaded to the bells and whistles of countless PowerPoint presentations ad Nauseum.</p>
<p>Walking in with a portfolio of beautifully rendered by hand, Wireframe Pictures can turn the hearts of the most hardened stakeholder.</p>
<p>Using professional grade are and bringing that artist with to change immediately sketch up or create new mockups right in front of the client’s eyes demonstrates a touch of class.</p>
<p>This idea goes all the way back to the age of steam where machine diagrams were works of art as well as functional.</p>
<p>In more recent days of Frank Lloyd Wright’s drawings, which today are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars just for their elegance and form.</p>
<p>Do the same for your mobile app Wireframes. It will capture the minds and souls of your clients as well or use any of the other ideas you’ve seen today.</p>
<p>Remember the goal is to make you dream a picture, the picture an app, and that app a reality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry-content">
<p>2014 is the year of the connected devices, or wearable tech. With the release of the Samsung Galaxy Gear Smartwatch, the upcoming release of the Apple iWatch, and the release of a whole range of wearable tech from many different manufacturers, it seems that this is the future of technology.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a smartwatch to quickly keep up to date with your daily tasks, and help keep you organized, or you are looking for a fitness tracker, there is a whole range of wearable, connected devices that look fantastic, and work well. Here are five of the best.</p>
<p><strong>Pebble Smart Watch</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pebble-smartwatch-bestbuy-main.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-37 size-medium" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pebble-smartwatch-bestbuy-main-300x245.jpg" alt="wearable tech" width="300" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the most stylish piece of wearable tech that is currently available on the market. It has a black and white e-ink display which makes the information on it clear to read, and great to look at.</p>
<p>It is useful because it can connect to both iPhone and Android, and can receive messages from both. It features an accelerometer, which means it can be used as an activity tracker.</p>
<p>This is widely regarded as the best smartwatch currently on the market.</p>
<p>You can buy it fromgetpebble.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jawbone Fitness Tracker</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/up-family-e1403860338784.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/up-family-e1403860338784.jpg" alt="iphone app developers" width="206" height="206" /></a></p>
<p>This in many ways is like most of the other fitness trackers on the market. It will count your steps, and your sleep. You will learn how many calories you are burning from exercise a day, and will give you a step target to try and meet every single day.</p>
<p>What sets this apart, and makes it really cool, is that unlike many rivals it actually looks good on the wrist. There are no displays, it isn’t very big, and to most people it will just just look like a bracelet.</p>
<p>You can buy it atjawbone.com.</p>
<p><strong>iWatch</strong></p>
<p>While this product hasn’t been announced yet, most industry experts agree that it is almost certainly coming in the very near future.</p>
<p>We have seen severalrumored designs, and with Apple’s track record it is almost certain that the iWatch will be one of the most beautiful connected devices on the market.</p>
<p>This will no doubt explode the wearable tech market, and will be the must have cool gadget (just like every other Apple product), so when it is announced you are going to want to move quickly to pre order your version.</p>
<p>When it is announced (probably in September), apple.com will be the place to go to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Nike+ Fuelband SE</strong></p>
<p>In terms of futuristic looking wearable tech, they don’t come much cooler looking than this. It has all the style that you would expect of a Nike product, and it works great too.</p>
<p>The biggest selling point is how simple it is. You are given an allocation of Nike Fuel every day, you gain more by exercising, and lose it by eating, so you can easily keep on target with your fitness goals.</p>
<p>What makes it even cooler is that it uses LED lights to give you a quick and easy way to see how you are doing. The colors change the closer to your goal you are.</p>
<p>You can buy it atstore.nike.com.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 Smartwatch</strong></p>
<p>This is the choice for the millions of people around the world who own a Samsung Galaxy phone. It looks cool, and it is designed to interact with the Samsung Galaxy, so it will work better than any other smartwatch with that piece of technology.</p>
<p>It replaced the Gear 1, and is widely regarded as a significant improvement. It runs on its own operating system, one that is specifically deigned by Samsung. So if you want a fast, responsive, feature packed smartwatch, then this is certainly a great choice.</p>
