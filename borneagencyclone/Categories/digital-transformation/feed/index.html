				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people have dismissed digital service delivery as a passing fad, charities should embrace digital service delivery as part of their long-term strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future.  Times of crisis and turmoil have always been catalysts for innovation. Suddenly and without warning, organisations and businesses have been forced to reinvent how they operate to survive, and for many, this has meant diving headfirst into digital service delivery and the unexplored waters of Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and more.</p>
<p>For a lot of charities, going digital was only ever meant to be a temporary solution to a temporary problem. But three months after the start of the UK lockdown, with the light beginning to show at the end of the tunnel, the time has come for honest reflection. The pandemic has exposed the many ways that we want ourselves, our societies and our organisations to change for good. Should the way charities deliver services be one of them?</p>
<p>It’s easy to focus on the losses and the setbacks. But for every charity that has suffered a closure of its services, many more are able to ask ’What have we learnt? What can our service users gain?’</p>
<p>Many charities are learning that by embracing digital they can engage more people in hard to reach groups, meet unexpected demand, stand out from the pack by going the extra mile for the people they support and save money while doing so.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of charities that are embracing tech in their future strategies:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2819 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charity-donations.jpg?_t=1595232738" alt="" width="930" height="523" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charity-donations.jpg 930w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charity-donations-300x169.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charity-donations-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Dingley’s Promise</strong></h2>
<p>Dingley’s Promise, a charity which supports under 5s with additional needs and disabilities, has been forced to quickly shift to digital, remote support and information sharing. As a result, they’ve found that they can reach more people and increase their impact like never, and say they’re likely to continue several their online activities after lockdown.</p>
<p>Once they had taken the plunge, CEO of Dingley’s Promise Catherine McLeod stated that the myths surrounding digital working and taking activities online have been broken and has become a core part of their community because decision-makers are now more comfortable with what benefits this approach can offer.</p>
<h2><strong>The Scouts</strong></h2>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://borneagency.com/blogs/the-great-indoors-scouts-honour-isolation-by-ramping-their-digital-approach/"><strong>blog post</strong></a>, we discussed the measures that the Scouts as a charity have taken on the path of digital transformation. The Scouts have long been synonymous with ’the great outdoors’. But when this became off-limits during lockdown, they were compelled to re-examine how they could keep their core values alive through digital.</p>
<p>It’s been a massive shift, but the charity has been able to repurpose resources from hundreds of scouting activities already at their disposal to keep its young service users learning and engaged remotely. Chief Digital Officer Lara Burns says she was blown away and truly inspired by the rapid digital transformation that is happening in the charity sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-2820 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/soundabout-logo.png?_t=1595232797" alt="" width="800" height="192" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/soundabout-logo.png 800w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/soundabout-logo-300x72.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/soundabout-logo-768x184.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Soundabout</strong></h2>
<p>Many charities have discovered demand for their services online that they never knew existed in the offline world. Soundabout, a charity which helps people with severe learning disabilities using music, is one of them.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the charity was seeing groups of eight people, plus their careers, in face-to-face sessions. However, its newly introduced live broadcasted Facebook sessions reach a community of over twelve thousand people. For this small charity, such a massive expansion in its reach means a permanent and profound change.</p>
<h2><strong>Auditory Verbal UK</strong></h2>
<p>Auditory Verbal UK’s shift to digital service delivery was driven by the need to carry on consistently delivering auditory and verbal therapy sessions for the deaf children it serves, ensuring that the lockdown wouldn’t have the knock-on effect of delaying their progress.</p>
<p>By moving quickly to digital, not only were they able to do this, but they increased their reach significantly beyond their geographical limitation. Based in London, the charity is now able to serve many people beyond the capital who might not afford the time and cost of travelling to access its services. Many organisations will not go back to the way things were as there is no new ‘normal’ Charities will continue to use remote and digital services to assist them.</p>
<h2><strong>Scunthorpe and District Mind</strong></h2>
<p>These are stressful times, and mental health charity Scunthorpe and District Mind have discovered that using remote video support for people in crisis lets them meet the increased demand for its services during lockdown. Not only can they reach many new service users suffering because of dramatic changes to their lives, but they can also now support people in remote rural areas through tech.</p>
<p>By evidencing that they can continue to deliver services safely and effectively through digital charities have been able to secure the vital funding they need to run now and in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology is transforming how people interact with history and heritage, providing unparalleled insight into our past. From deciphering ancient manuscripts with image processing and machine learning, right through to the recent 3D modelling of priceless artefacts and creating interactive exhibitions. Museums are remodelling their existing approaches to art, incorporating technology not just to improve exhibitions but to expand and even breakdown the notion of what is art in a time of easing lockdown measures in the UK.</p>
<p>The digitisation of documents, for example, is playing a key role in preservation; with museums, libraries and private collections around the world using technology to enhance their capabilities and ensure that historic documents will still be accessible in decades, even centuries to come. There is a mass digitisation across the world and an example of this can be seen from a handwriting recognition technology known as <a href="https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/"><strong>Transkribus</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This image processing and machine learning processing software helps produce transcripts of hand-written archival material. With more than 22,000 users worldwide, Transkribus showcases how tech can have an enormous impact in this field and simplify previously arduous, time-consuming processes.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, however, technology is helping to open cultural heritage to new generations, with people from around the world now able to draw upon resources to gain a clearer understanding of the world they live in.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious new forms of new technologies, that will be infiltrating your local museum will probably be either virtual reality, augmented reality or a bit of both.<strong> </strong><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/vr-and-holographic-technology-make-the-star-trek-holodeck-a-reality"><strong>VR</strong></a> and <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/11-times-ar-was-used-to-create-hyperrealistic-immersive-broadcasts"><strong>AR</strong></a><strong> </strong>technology is already widely popular and is being incorporated into exhibitions.</p>
<p>Augmented reality is an excellent tool for museums interested in bridging the gap between the digital and real, displaying landscapes, data, and animations in real time.</p>
<p>Places like the <a href="https://www.pamm.org/"><strong>Pérez Art Museum</strong></a><strong> </strong>in Miami or the Kremer Museum have encouraged artists to use VR to provide unique full sensory experiences to on-goers. While in more historical museums like the metropolitan museum, VR is used to transport people to different times and places for the ultimate immersive experience.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2777 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woman-standing-in-front-of-paintings-952588-1024x683.jpg?_t=1594286967" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woman-standing-in-front-of-paintings-952588.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woman-standing-in-front-of-paintings-952588-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woman-standing-in-front-of-paintings-952588-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>The Internet of Things</strong></h2>
<p>An <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/iot-revolution-5-ways-the-internet-of-things-will-change-transportation"><strong>IoT ecosystem</strong></a><strong> </strong>is important in the heritage and arts sector. Whether through your own smart device or via technology provided by a museum, the internet of things helps curators not only tell more cohesive stories, but it also provides insightful data on visitors and exhibitions. Dubbed the smart museum, the IoT interconnected gallery can do a host of things, including gaining insight on visitors by collecting data about their behaviours and interests, as well as, measuring a collection’s performance, moving beyond the number of visitors and revenues.</p>
<p>A museum may be able to tailor an exhibition to your likes and interests. What you may see during an exhibition and what your friend might see could be two entirely different things in the museum of the future. Though being slowly adopted in places like the Louvre, the IoT helps exhibitions and curators properly structure the flow, feeling and work on display in a gallery.</p>
<h2><strong>AI Artists</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/will-ai-art-supplant-humans-as-the-artists-of-the-future"><strong>Artificial intelligence and art</strong></a><strong> </strong>may not be something that you believe that coexists already, but it is here. Aside from using AI to improve the overall gallery experiences, curators are even looking to AI as the next artist to watch. Just in 2018, a painting completed by GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), an AI entity, sold at the world-famous auction house Christie’s for nearly $500,000 attracting the attention of the world. AI has proven that it can create art that can rival some of the artistic greats. Even more so, the appeal of AI-generated art is tremendous, attracting fans from across the globe. Though it is still somewhat of an anomaly, AI in museums and in art is part of a bigger growing trend. Curators are hungry more than ever to find artists in this new digital frontier who are using technology to wow audiences.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Products in the Museum and Gallery Space  </strong></h2>
<p>London has a fantastic art scene, but finding temporary exhibitions while on the move can be difficult. Many exhibitions are only around for a short time meaning art fanatics often miss out, as they don’t know when or where various exhibitions are occurring. Our team at <a href="https://borneagency.com/">Borne</a> collaborated with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.borne.gowithyamo&amp;hl=en_GB"><strong>gowithYamo</strong></a> to create a free app which connects inspired art lovers with the best nearby exhibitions in all major cities. Built with user needs in mind, the app was designed to help users discover art galleries and exhibitions around their specification and all over London.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2770 " src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_35_18.png" alt="" width="325" height="328" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_35_18.png 260w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_35_18-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 85vw, 325px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-2774" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_27_02-280x300.png" alt="" width="325" height="348" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_27_02-280x300.png 280w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-marvelapp-ca9f08h-screen-60571546-2019-11-04-10_27_02.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 85vw, 325px" /></p>
<p>The app was designed to help users discover art galleries and exhibitions around specific locations and all over London. The focus was to ensure users could discover exhibitions they otherwise may not have known about. Our team at Borne are currently collaborating with gowithYamo in exploring virtual exhibitions for people that cannot may not have access to these exhibitions, especially as lockdown measures are gradually lifted in the UK. By museums and galleries incorporating tech into their marketing strategy, these spaces will become more accessible. Capitalising on rapid technological advances will be key to cultural heritage preservation in years to come.</p>
<p>Through the adoption of emerging technologies, the humanities will be a key component in shaping the future of society. By enabling people to immerse themselves in the past and the arts, we can gain a clearer view of our present and future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the COVID-19 outbreak begins to fade away, the impact of the pandemic will still leave a devastating effect on various sectors around the world. A sector that has felt this significantly is the construction sector. Social distancing rules across numerous countries are having a significant effect on construction sites, countless sites across the planet have had to either slow down operations or postpone all together which has caused massive delays.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Although it is set to take a very long time for the industry to recover fully from the outbreak, next-gen tech may prove to be a very valuable resource in getting things back-up and running again. It could enable many firms to recover from their COVID-19 losses in less time than what it could potentially be. The construction industry is set to embrace remote working both in the short and the long term to help reduce costs in addition to the interest of worker’s health and safety.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has highlighted that a lot of the work which is done in the construction sector can be done remotely with ease. Engineers, technologists, project management and architects have been working from home during the duration of the pandemic and it is expected that some will remain working from home for the next 12-18 months. It is something that will stick around in the long term.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2740 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/person-holding-black-pen-1109541-1024x683.jpg?_t=1593079027" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/person-holding-black-pen-1109541-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/person-holding-black-pen-1109541-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/person-holding-black-pen-1109541-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/person-holding-black-pen-1109541-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Providing New Projects</strong></h2>
<p>COVID has revealed and highlighted how the lack of technological infrastructure across companies such as the UK and in the United States has placed the construction sector in an un-ideal position. Nations need to embrace the modern technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to move forward from the crisis. The use of these innovations will also prove useful for any future crisis that may occur in years to come. Globally, this infrastructure is lacking in the construction sector is in desperate need of reform. According to The American Society of Civil Engineers, most construction sector infrastructures have not stepped up to meet the modern standard. Improved energy grids and 5G cell towers are all ways which can help create job roles in the construction sector space.</p>
<h2><strong>Filling in For Absent Workers</strong></h2>
<p>The current economy is not expected to bounce back to ‘normal’ any time soon, and it is expected that many industry workers will be slow to return. Luckily, robotics within industries like the construction and manufacturing sector is becoming more popular than ever before. The use of this tech could prove extremely useful when filling in for workers that remain absent. Robotics perform almost 50% of construction job roles. In the long run, companies could potentially see a reduction in cost compared to human workers, and increased efficiency thanks to longer operation times and overall optimisation.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2741 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Insights-Robots-n-Contruction-Page-Hero-2-1000x470.jpg?_t=1593079073" alt="" width="1000" height="470" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Insights-Robots-n-Contruction-Page-Hero-2-1000x470.jpg 1000w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Insights-Robots-n-Contruction-Page-Hero-2-1000x470-300x141.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Insights-Robots-n-Contruction-Page-Hero-2-1000x470-768x361.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Increase in Productivity</strong></h2>
<p>Tech not only has the potential to fill in positions for absent construction workers but they have the potential to help traditional workers increase their productivity through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analysis. The construction sector has a history of being less productive in comparison to other industries and if productivity does not improve post-COVID-19, inefficiency will set in further which will mean the time it takes for the industry to recover will increase into the future.</p>
<h2><strong>Acquisition of Equipment</strong></h2>
<p>A primary challenge facing the construction sector amid a recession is the growing cost of equipment. This puts many companies in a state of dilemma as a lot of the modem construction equipment that can help drive efficiency and digital transformation can often be very expensive. This can be a big hurdle to jump for smaller construction firms. Luckily, costs for equipment can be reduced by relying more on tech. A more productive use of the internet can help firms find equipment at lower costs which would be difficult to find in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. E-commerce has a range of advantages and this is just one of them.</p>
<p>Although on-site work has been stopped or severely reduced due to lockdowns in numerous countries around the world, many functions in the AEC industry such as architecture, engineering and project management can continue relatively undisturbed. New technologies are also being embraced which is helping limit the impact caused by the current pandemic. The pandemic could see a brighter future for cutting-edge technology in the industry such as drone tech, communication tools, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), building information modelling (BIM) and much more. These technologies actively encourage health and safety in the industry whilst helping employees meet social distancing requirements. These technologies are set to stay and develop further long after COVID-19 vanishes. Finally, when looking at the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the construction sector, the current trends such as remote working, adoption of the latest technology and increased health and safety procedures all look like they are here to stay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Digitisation Is the Answer</strong></h2>
<p>Tech is changing the way every industry does business by helping to save money, create efficiencies and provide better services and products. Retail businesses have recently jumped on the bandwagon and are also adopting tech to their advantage during the difficult times that COVID has brought to the retail sector.</p>
<p>The end-to-end customer journey now begins with online research and product comparison, and complaining about a product or service is as easy and public as sending a tweet or Facebook comment, prompting immediate action before reputational damage occurs. Where once businesses competed on price and availability, they now compete for search engine rankings and five-star customer reviews to keep ahead during this pandemic. This shift from in-store only to omnichannel spending has forced companies to make huge adjustments to the way they do business.</p>
<p>To make it through the pandemic, businesses are embracing digitisation more than ever before. Across all industries, specifically retail, increasing numbers of companies are adopting and perfecting digital tools to access consumers that lie just beyond reach in the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Here are the top tech trends that we believe will transform the retail space in 2020: </u></strong></p>
<h2><strong>VR and AR</strong></h2>
<p>Even when consumers purchase products online during the pandemic, they often go to a brick-and-mortar retailer to see the physical products first. But these in-person trips to the store are crumbling under the weight of quarantine orders. The retail industry obviously needs to “innovate or die” as COVID runs its course.</p>
<p>Virtual and augmented reality offer retailers several ways to enhance the customer experience. From browsing products to virtually “trying them on,” <a href="https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1313"><strong>extended reality</strong></a> is already in use by many retailers today. Teen surf and sports clothing retailer<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/06/14/augmented-reality-nets-real-results-for-tillys/"><strong> Tilly’s</strong></a><strong> </strong>offered its customers a back-to-school scavenger hunt experience that helped their customers explore different clothes and accessories.</p>
<p>Extended reality can also provide additional information for customers when they are browsing for products such as the “<a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/05/living-wine-labels-celebrates-national-wine-day-with-auggie-award-nomination/"><strong>Living Wine Labels</strong></a>” from Treasury Wines Estates. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/ikea-place-the-retailers-first-arkit-app-creates-lifelike-pictures-of-furniture-in-your-home/"><strong> IKEA Place</strong></a><strong> </strong>ARKit app helps you determine if the furniture you want to purchase will fit and look good in your space. In the future, extended reality will eventually enable consumers to be able to share their shopping experience with others.</p>

<h2><strong>Big Data (Predictive Analytics)</strong></h2>
<p>Retail organisations have never had an issue in the collection of large quantities of data. But, analysing the data to solve problems or create new solutions has been a struggle. <a href="https://acuvate.com/blog/top-5-predictive-analytics-use-cases-retail-industry/"><strong>Predictive analytics</strong></a><strong> </strong>changes that. Retailers now can be proactive about the future, as the future of retail is on the rocks during this pandemic, by analysing consumer behaviour and trends from the past.</p>
<p>When retailers successfully analyse data, they can understand important information about consumer purchasing behaviour, personalise the shopping experience, address a consumer’s needs based on where they are in the customer journey, improve efficiencies and reduce costs of supply chains and more. Predictive analytics helps retailers be smarter, reduce costs and be more efficient overall.</p>
<h2><strong>Micro Moments</strong></h2>
<p>When you think about how you use Google or your favourite search engine, you rely on finding what you need in the moment, whether that’s for the celebration or how to solve a problem. Retailers who can meet customers “in the moment” have a powerful advantage. Thanks to direct digital access to consumers and powerful analytics capabilities, businesses can capture moments and help customers during their moment of need and even anticipate what a customer might need before they even know it.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendation Engines</strong></h2>
<p>Another powerful tech tool for retailers is recommendation engines that help customers find things they never knew they needed and to help funnel options to a consumer at relevant times in their shopping journey. Recommendation engines get better over time. The more data the algorithms assess a customer’s shopping behaviour, the better the recommendations. Retailers can benefit from higher cart sales and improved customer satisfaction thanks to the ease of use. Spotify, Netflix and Amazon are the engines that you may be most familiar with.</p>
<h2><strong>Order Fulfilment Automation </strong></h2>
<p>By the end of 2025, more than 580,000 autonomous mobile robots (AMR) will be deployed to help warehouse fulfil customer orders. Many retailers are scrambling to adjust to the “Amazon Effect” and are exploring order fulfilment automation to try to increase the speed and flexibility of operations to complete with Amazon. This automation can significantly reduce order processing times. Warehouses have also struggled to find enough human labourers to keep up with demand, so automated systems would be an attractive solution for this.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2717 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/44275734970_a16c08039d_c.jpg?_t=1592489304" alt="" width="799" height="533" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/44275734970_a16c08039d_c.jpg 799w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/44275734970_a16c08039d_c-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/44275734970_a16c08039d_c-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Facial Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>Many of the most successful retailers have online and offline presences. Facial recognition tech assists retailers proactively battle retail crime and shoplifting. It can also bring the personalised online shopping experience to the brick-and-mortar location. When a customer is identified through facial recognition, the store staff can better respond to that customer’s unique needs. However, there are certain legal and privacy concerns to be worked out, but there are several advantages for retailers who adopted facial recognition tech.</p>
<h2><strong>Management of Stock</strong></h2>
<p>Automated warehouses help improve inventory control. Rather than wait for manual inventories, smart robotics and computer systems keep reliable stock data in real-time. This accurate data helps retailers manage stock flow, make solid predictions, smart decisions, and forecasting that help improve the store&#8217;s bottom line. Better inventory management of raw, in-process, and finished goods reduces waste, spoilage, and even theft.</p>
<h2><strong>Automated Store Assistants</strong></h2>
<p>Another tech trend that’s changing shopping is robotic store assistants. <a href="https://robotsoflondon.co.uk/pepper-the-retail-assistant"><strong>Pepper, an example of this robotic store assistants</strong></a>, can help shoppers find the merchandise they are looking for and answer questions. They can also email special coupons or special offers. Home improvement store Lowe’s has the Lowebot that helps with in-store customer service.</p>
<h2><strong>Chat Bots in Customer Service</strong></h2>
<p>There has been rapid adoption of messaging-based customer service bots across retail. Messaging has become the preferred customer service channel, so call volume will be reduced. Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots can improve the journey of the customer pre- and post-sales by lowering cart abandonment and help customers solve problems after the sale without the use of human intervention. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Smart Equipment and IoT</strong></h2>
<p>Smart equipment and the Internet of Things (IoT) will transform the shopping experience. Thanks to the large volumes of data that we have available and the ability to process it, consumers can receive a personalised shopping experience that was not possible before. Today’s consumers want experienced that include information and personalisation to help in making decisions. IoT technology helps stores deliver these experiences to these customers. Smart equipment such as sensor embedded shelves that track inventory will also change retail operations.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that digitisation is no longer optional. As society continually changes with new realities like quarantining, only the most innovative businesses are surviving. It’s crucial to think of ways to bring your customer to your products, even if your customer never leaves her home.</p>
<p>It’s also important to think of new ways to virtually bring your employees to work, conferences, and events. If you can find new ways to deliver value and convenience, all at a distance, you’ll likely thrive as a business operating in the era of COVID-19.</p>
