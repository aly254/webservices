				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is important to consider the visibility of your brand for your customers and follow what the &#8216;next-big-thing&#8217; may be in advertising and marketing. There are numerous effective marketing channels that you could make use of which we are all familiar with: TV, endorsements, outdoor advertising etc. However, household name brands such as Dominos, Starbucks and Avis to name a few have used mobile apps to help their business break new ground in their industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Should Your Brand Go Digital?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.holidayswap.com/?campaign=6881293146&amp;keyword=holiday%20swap&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8WaREytWLb0RdiD13KNqBgekdrArJ6YDuHEMfUsSAZuOjivzyuQL7oaAqpHEALw_wcB"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2487" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2-1024x1024.png?_t=1575466478" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2-150x150.png 150w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2-300x300.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2-768x768.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hs2.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>What brands need to consider, is that we live in an age where most people use a smartphone. According to a report done by <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8XmhstmPnd78IfjCYPHEOIxKQr7H8OIIzpYb4gtRQhHGfobagPNGt4aAj9ZEALw_wcB&amp;sfdcid=7016F000002NlbH&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=FLO&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=&amp;utm_term=app+annie"><strong>App Annie</strong></a>, studying the use of apps over the course of 2016-2018, the total time spent on apps has increased by 50% globally. In the U.S alone, the average user spends almost 3 hours a day on apps alone out of a total of 4 hours on mobile devices. Smartphones are a marketing channel where your brand may find everyone in your target audience. Why not take the opportunity to reach your customers by promoting your business through an app?</p>

<h2><strong>Top Benefits of Using Mobile Platforms as A Marketing Tool</strong></h2>
<h3 class="LC20lb"><span class="S3Uucc"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span class="S3Uucc">Increase Your Brand Awareness</span></h3>
<p>Marketing agencies are always on the hunt for new platforms to advertise their brands and place logos. However, if you have the platform to have users unlock their phones and see your brand&#8217;s logo, you would be increasing your brand&#8217;s visibility and in turn increasing your customer base.</p>
<h3 class="LC20lb"><span class="S3Uucc"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span class="S3Uucc">Collection of Data About Your Users</span></h3>
<p>Once you have collaborated with a software house or digital agency, your app would hopefully solve a particular problem for your users. You would not need to email your users individually or ask them to fill out forms for a bonus or incentive, Instead, you can make use of in-app incentives for your users in order to gain feedback as the app is already an incentive in itself. You can use:</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;&gt; Questionnares for bonuses</strong></p>
<p>If you plan on having a mobile application that has discount codes, your company could provide these codes, special offers or bonuses for completing the surveys.</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;&gt; Analysis of in-app behaviour</strong></p>
<p>This can be the secret weapon for obtaining information on your users in an ethical way. It is the most common method used for loyalty apps. When a user leaves a review on your product or purchases a product if your company is product-bases, you can collect this data about their purchasing habits and marketing your business accordingly. Starbucks makes use of this method to test and try out new ideas, and roll out targeted data-driven initiatives.</p>
<h3 class="LC20lb"><span class="S3Uucc"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Grow Your Audience</span></h3>
<p>A mobile application can serve as a great way to attract new customers to your brand and create brand awareness. American conglomerate Chipotle saw a gap in the market by offering a delivery service through their app. Thanks to the addition of a delivery app, their digital sales had increased by 65.6 percent compared to the previous quarter for 12.9 percent of their total sales.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2504" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones-300x300.png" alt="" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones-300x300.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones-150x150.png 150w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones-768x768.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UnifiPhones.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 85vw, 450px" /></p>
<h3 class="LC20lb"><span class="S3Uucc"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Increase Sales </span></h3>
<p>By making the buying process more convenient and intuitive through the use of digital products such as apps, this can facilitate the customer&#8217;s experience which would ultimately improve sales overall. However, like we have addressed previously, this does not mean that sales have to be made through the app directly but through the offering through loyalty programmes. An example of this can be seen in the sales issues experienced by Domino&#8217;s Pizza in the mid-2000s. Domino&#8217;s stock hit an all-time low in 2008, costing only $3 per share. However, today it is worth $246. One reason may be the digitalisation of the company. Domino&#8217;s decided to take a mobile-first approach. By creating a branded mobile app that provided an experience that was responsive, they completely shifted their business model.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, we wrote an article to help you answer the question of &#8216;What Next?&#8217;, when launch day finally comes around. The resounding answer? Well, an awful lot. There&#8217;s advertising to be planned, social content to be perfected and feedback to be responded to. But marketing doesn&#8217;t just begin when your app launches. The majority of successful mobile apps will have had a marketing strategy in place from the get-go.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our top tips for getting your marketing strategy in place before your app has even launched:</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Set Objectives</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launching a marketing campaign without any goals is like visiting IKEA on a Saturday afternoon without a shopping list. It&#8217;s not only a huge waste of time, it&#8217;s also likely to end in divorce. We&#8217;re not sure why or how, but take our word for it.</p>
<p>Set yourself an end goal and work backwards to figure out which campaigns to go with. These goals could include brand awareness, building an email list, reaching a certain engagement % on social media. Statistics are important and don&#8217;t just pull some numbers out of the air willy-nilly, actually put some thought into it.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re launching a mobile app or a chain of gluten-free, vegan restaurants, competitor analysis is an essential part of the process. You only need to watch one episode of <em>The Apprentice </em>to see how ugly things can get when the basics are overlooked, and competitor analysis is one of these basics.</p>
<p>Analysing your competitors involves evaluating anyone who does the same thing as you. Have a look at their marketing strategies, their target users, brand values, profitability, strengths and weaknesses in their campaign &#8211; the list is endless!</p>
<p>Ideally, competitor analysis should be done before the project even begins for two reasons. Firstly, to ensure there is actually a gap in the market for your project. In an over-saturated market it&#8217;s essential to determine your unique selling point, and researching other companies will ensure no one is doing the same. Secondly, it enables you to learn from your competitors successes and mistakes and avoid making the same from the offset. We all love a marketing fail, but as well as laughing at yet another monumental screw up, let&#8217;s try to learn from them.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Know Your Target User</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we had a pound for each time one of our clients had no idea what kind of person they&#8217;re targeting, well, I&#8217;d probably be on a beach in Mexico.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-perfect-meeting/">branding meetings</a> at the start of a project often include a target user profiling session. Put together a list of your users&#8217; goals and needs, which will help you when it comes to creating and targeting your campaigns.</p>
<p>Your product must help your target user accomplish their goals, whether it&#8217;s relieving boredom on their commute, finally managing to lose weight or finding a new partner.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Optimise Your App Store Page</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written multiple posts on <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-1-app-store-optimisation/">app store optimisation</a>, so we won&#8217;t go into too much detail here. All we will say is keywords, keywords and more keywords.</p>
<p>And we don&#8217;t want them stuffed into your app store description like an overfilled sofa cushion. They need to be delicately placed into your copy strategically and carefully &#8211; use the same care and consideration you would use to place strawberries on a slightly-underdone chocolate brownie. Have we been watching too much Great British Bake Off? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5></h5>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Start A Blog</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are often put off starting a blog as they believe they can&#8217;t write. If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in my life it&#8217;s this; you do not need to be able to write well to start a blog. Sure, it helps. But my morning scroll through Medium&#8217;s top stories has taught me that running a successful blog is so much more than just being able to write well.</p>
<p>It is not knowing your similes from your metaphors or using a synonym for every word you type. It&#8217;s about personality and actually useful advice. Blogging will help you to build the hype around your brand, target specific people and bring traffic to your website. Plus, it gives you something to do while your app developers are busy writing 6 months worth of code in a windowless basement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Build A Social Presence</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting to build a brand without a social media presence is definitely possible, but you&#8217;re likely making your life more difficult. If you&#8217;re not social savvy enough to manage your own social media profiles, it&#8217;s worth getting someone else in to help. These days millennials know their way around a Twitter feed better than they know their way around their own town (I&#8217;m allowed to say this &#8211; I&#8221;m a millennial), and most of us only require enough money to get our weekly avocado toast fix.</p>
<p>Social media profiles are an excellent way to make your brand appear more &#8216;human&#8217;. Twitter allows brands to quickly respond to feedback and complaints, while Instagram can provide a valuable &#8216;behind-the-scenes&#8217; insight into the creation of your app. Social profiles are essential when it comes to building a pre-launch &#8216;buzz&#8217; around your product &#8211; think sneak peaks or giveaways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve developed your app and have been given the App Store go ahead? Well, that&#8217;s really only half the battle.</p>
<p>According to a study done by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/">TechCrunch</a>, nearly one in four users abandon an app after just one use, so not only do you have to <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/do-something-different/">drive downloads</a>, you will also need to work to keep your users interested.</p>
<p>Luckily, we know a thing or two about mobile app engagement, Here&#8217;s our top tips and tricks to keep your users engaged, interested and coming back for more&#8230;</p>
<p><u>Have An Engaging App To Begin With!</u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re hoping that before you even start developing your app you will know its purpose, but this is something to keep in mind to ensure you don&#8217;t go off track.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As mobile app developers, we are always reiterating to our clients how important it is that the app actually adds some sort of <em>value </em>to their user&#8217;s life. Whether that&#8217;s by eliminating boredom on the bus, helping them find the <a href="http://www.getstreats.com">best places to eat in London</a>, or managing their finances &#8211; each app must serve a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An app simply cannot succeed if there is no clear use for it. You can have the best UI design, complex features and a million pound marketing budget; but if your users are not immediately hooked, it&#8217;s likely that your app will eventually be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So our number one tip for making sure users keep returning to your app? Have an app that&#8217;s good in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seamless On-Boarding</span></p>
<p>A quick and simple on-boarding experience is essential in reducing abandonment rates. Asking for too many details or making sign-up confusing will result in users throwing in the towel and deleting your app, possibly to never return to it again. It&#8217;s essential that your sign-up is as pain-free as possible for the user.</p>
<p>Seamless on-boarding means only asking for essential information and not confusing your user with too many features or too much text. The user should be able to sign-up in very few steps. Remember, this is the part of the app where you really cannot afford to make any mistakes. Users may forgive a small niggle later on, but as during sign up they have not yet discovered what your app can actually do for them, they are far more likely to abandon it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Engage With Your Users!</span></p>
<p>App engagement is a two way street &#8211; you cannot expect users to engage with your app regularly if you do not respond to them, and we don&#8217;t<em> </em>mean a generic &#8216;you haven&#8217;t logged on in a while&#8217; pop-up!</p>
<p>Used in the right way, push notifications and reminders are a great way to keep your users engaged and ensure that your app is always in the back of their minds. Pushing strategies should, of course, be <em>user </em>centred, and not just a blind stab at encouraging them to open up your app &#8211; irrelevant or &#8216;spammy&#8217; push notifications are more than likely to end in a rage quit.</p>
<p>Specific reminders or incentives however, are a good place to start. Take advantage of user data &#8211; such as location or interests. These will allow you to tailor your notifications to each specific user, ensuring they are are relevant, personal and, most importantly, actually useful.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listen To Feedback</span></p>
<p>User feedback is hugely important when it comes to keeping your app up to date and in tip-top condition. Don&#8217;t just rely on the testing provided by your app development company &#8211; they are more likely to focus on ironing out the bugs and polishing off certain features. Realistically, there is no substitute for feedback from people who will actually be using your app, so <em>listen </em>to any comments you are given and respond to it. Updating content, adding new features and refining your UI regularly will be sure to keep your users interested.</p>
<p>Tracking which screens or features may cause users to drop off is another essential. We recommend using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/">Firebase Analytics</a> to monitor user behaviour within the app and see which features may or may not be working.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage Social Sharing</span></p>
<p>We write a lot about the <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-2-using-instagram-to-drive-downloads/">power of social media</a> when it comes to driving downloads, but it can also be used to increase user engagement.</p>
<p>Allow users to easily share their progress or results on Facebook and you guarantee both a higher engagement rates and more visibility for your product. A great example of this is by fitness app <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>. After each run, the user is asked if they wish to share their running stats to Facebook or Twitter. Doing this will have a number of effects. It will inspire a healthy dose of competition in your user&#8217;s friends, ensure that the name of your app reaches people who may have similar interests, and also encourages your user to keep returning in order to impress their friends and followers!</p>
<p>Another great option is to offer incentives for sharing. Many games offer points or access to secret levels if the user shares their progress on social media, and this is definitely something to consider. If done correctly, these incentives will increase user engagement and continue to drive downloads, as more people want in on the action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1149" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Browse-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-20-at-16.23.54.png" alt="mobile app developers " width="719" height="561" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1143" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerFront-1024x723.png" alt="mobile app developers" width="840" height="593" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1142" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerBack-1024x723.png" alt="street food london" width="840" height="593" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Finished Product</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to part 3 of our app launch series, helping you gain exposure for your app and increase downloads.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, getting the name of your app out there has become harder than getting a seat on the Northern Line in rush hour. To put it simply, there are too many people trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>When the App and Play Stores are dominated by the likes of Tinder, Candy Crush and Instagram, it can be hard to find your feet. But it’s important to remember that even the top downloaded apps started out as mere ideas too. With some clever marketing, nifty tricks and a quick look at the tactics of those who have absolutely smashed it, you will be able to gain exposure for your app before it’s even launched.</p>
<p><u>Be Different</u></p>
<p>From collaborating with an unexpected brand to running a marathon dressed in an iPhone outfit (kudos to RunKeeper for this!) there’s a number of ways that you can gain exposure for your app in ways that could excite, confuse or intrigue your potential users.</p>
<p>For an example of this we will look to the horribly addictive Angry Birds. In 2011, Angry Birds set up a real life game in the middle of Barcelona. Locals and tourists used smartphones to control a real life slingshot while a live band played the music featured in the game.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not possible to do something as huge as this when just starting out, but by doing something a bit different, Angry Birds landed media coverage on hundreds of blogs and videos of the life-size game were widely shared online. Anything that gets potential users talking, sharing or hash-tagging is a win when it comes to marketing your app.</p>
<p><u>Create A Teaser Video</u></p>
<p>Teaser videos started as a nice touch but have now become something of an essential.</p>
<p>A bit like a movie trailer, you can be as creative or as wacky as you like. But remember, sometimes simplicity wins (everyone remember Flappy Bird?). Having a video showing either a demo of the game or a sneak peek will make users excited. Humans are predominantly visual and love to be shown something as opposed to simply told about it.</p>
<p>Although you may have to put some money aside for creating and promoting the video, if it manages to spark interest and increase engagement, it’ll be worth it.</p>
<p><u>Appeal To What People Love</u></p>
<p>Just a quick glance at Facebook and Twitter trends and you can get a pretty good idea of what people are loving when it comes to social media.</p>
<p>A company who did a great job of appealing to the masses was Uber, who took advantage of National Cat Day. The company’s campaign UberKITTENS was used to promote adopting animals from shelters as opposed to breeders. On National Cat Day, users in a number of US and Canadian cities were able to hail an UberKITTEN to their office, with 15 minutes of cuddle and playtime with a kitten costing $30.</p>
<p>Uber nailed this campaign for so many reasons, many of which we can learn from. They worked alongside something people love, and that is, cat videos. We are all guilty of logging onto Facebook with the intention of replying to a message and being lured into a four-hour cat video binge. Uber knew this, and they played up to it.</p>
<p>National Cat Day is the day that users are posting about cats, tweeting about cats and thinking about cats. What better way to gain exposure for your company than actually giving people real life cats to play with, photos of which they will no doubt share on social media? Hats off to UberKITTENS, they absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Two takeaways from this hugely successful campaign? Do your research and make sure your timing is impeccable. UberKITTENS would have worked almost any day of the year because, let’s face it, it’s adorable. But the fact that it was National Cat Day just heightened the campaign’s success. There is no point launching a fitness app two weeks before Christmas! New Year’s Day on the other hand couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate &#8211; just make sure you follow our app launch series to help you beat the competition!</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing your app there is no better advice than have fun, get creative and be different. The users will come running. Check back in next week for the next part of our app launch series!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to part 2 of our app launch series, containing all our little tips and tricks to make sure your app launch is a success! Last time, we looked at <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/part-1-app-store-optimisation/">app store optimisation</a> and the reason it is so important, alongside some nifty tricks to make your app stand out from the rest.</p>
<p>This week, we are moving onto the use of Instagram when it comes to promoting your app. The social platform which began as somewhere that millennials could post pictures of their avocado toast has now become a vital ingredient in your mixing pot of marketing techniques &#8211; although the avocado toast days are far from over.</p>
<p>Instagram is a reliable and effective business tool. Whether it&#8217;s a start up looking to market their latest digital product or an already established brand reaching out to their loyal customers, Instagram can do wonders for your business.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our top tips for using your Instagram page to connect with users, drive downloads and increase website traffic.</p>
<p><u>Tone Of Voice</u></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8217;ll say it again, consistency is key. If your app development company are also doing your branding for you then the tone of voice will be something that crops up time and time again. However, Instagram is a different sort of platform and, in our experience, the kind of copy that you may use on platforms like LinkedIn may not go down quite as well on Instagram.</p>
<p>If your app or product is generally fun, playful and entertaining, then there&#8217;s no need to change what you&#8217;re doing. Make sure your Instagram description and bio mirror this.</p>
<p>If the nature of your product is more formal, serious or professional however, then we recommend taking this opportunity to show off a more personal side to your business. Instagram works best when it is used to showcase the personalities behind your brand or a sneak-peak into the day-to-day life of your product and employees; allowing your users to feel that they can connect with you personally. Adapt your voice to suit the tone of the platform, personal, light-hearted and relaxed.</p>
<p><u>Hashtags</u></p>
<p>Hashtags can do wonders for the engagement on your pictures, as without them there&#8217;s very little to actually help users discover you! Your hashtags will allow potential users to stumble across pages which they otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have seen. However, like all good things, there is always the temptation to overdo it.</p>
<p>The hashtags you use on Instagram need to be relevant to your app. While it may get you a few more followers or likes to continually hashtag your posts with #followforfollow or #likeforlike, it&#8217;s not going to attract the right sort of people &#8211; aka potential users. Plus, for anyone who is genuinely interested in your app, an excess of irrelevant hashtags can look spammy and cheap which may put them off exploring your Instagram or product further.</p>
<p>Using relevant hashtags that will appeal to people who are looking for a product just like yours is the best way to effectively utilise them. Pay attention to other hashtags that are being used on similar products to yours, as this will help you appeal to the right people and stay on top of the competition.</p>
<p><u>Captions</u></p>
<p>Instagram will cut off your caption after 3-4 lines of text, so it is best to chuck the important stuff at your users before they have to click &#8216;more&#8217;. Pop the hashtags, mentions and any extra information at the end of your captions, they are there to help users discover your page and, unless your hashtags are used humorously, won&#8217;t add anything extra for people who have already discovered your images.</p>
<p>The four lines the user can see should be enticing, engaging and make them want to read more. And remember, if the link to your product is in your bio, you should tell your followers! &#8216;Link in bio&#8217; is all that&#8217;s needed at the end of your caption, that way your users know where to go to get the product you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Including a call to action is another great technique when it comes to writing your captions. If you have a large following it can be a great way to get people to engage with your photos, but it&#8217;s worth doing even if you&#8217;re just starting out.</p>
<p>Examples of using calls to actions to increase engagement are, &#8216;share your story in the comments&#8217;, &#8216;double tap if you agree&#8217; or, &#8216;we&#8217;d love to know what you think&#8217;. Instagram also now allows users to &#8216;like&#8217; and reply to comments, so you can even engage with user’s reactions to your images. Remember, Instagram is personal. It&#8217;s rarely about the hard-sell and instead should be used as a way to engage with your users, explore other pages and showcase your creativity.</p>
<p><u>Bio</u></p>
<p>Currently, Instagram does not allow users to post links in their descriptions which, to be honest, is one of the things we love about it. It may not be as effective for startups and brands trying to promote their website, product or app, but for now we&#8217;re just going to have to work with what we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Of course, you should include your main link in your bio. Alongside a short description of what your product actually is, we recommend a call to action, encouraging any potential users or followers to get cracking with the download. Users should feel like they <em>need </em>your app, that it is the answer they&#8217;ve been looking for or that it will fill a gaping void in their lives. If you are struggling to make your app sound like a necessary, engaging or useful product then, well, why did you bother developing it?</p>
<p>Users need to be convinced in those few lines that you will add something substantial to their Instagram feeds. But remember that Instagram is a community in which you should connect with your followers on a personal level. Your bio should pop with a bit of personality. No one likes a bore on Instagram, that&#8217;s what LinkedIn is for.</p>
<p><u>The Actual Images</u></p>
<p>We can talk about hashtags, descriptions and captions until the cows come home, but at the end of the day, Instagram is a predominantly visual platform. Spending hours putting together an engaging description explaining why followers should download your app is all very well, but if the image accompanying this creative masterpiece is low quality or irrelevant, you&#8217;re not going to get very far.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is essential that you spend some time working on the images posted in your Instagram feed. Not only do the pictures have to relevant to your product, eye catching and high quality, it is worth noting how the images fit together on your &#8216;grid&#8217;. You can easily use your camera role to put a collection of photos together and see how they look. Although it&#8217;s not essential, we recommend sticking to a similar &#8216;theme&#8217; throughout your feed. This ensures that, collectively, your feed is aesthetically pleasing and showcases something that is of a high quality. Consistency in colour schemes and themes will attract followers and hopefully drive visits to your website or further downloads.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for part 2 of our app launch series, check back in next week for more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest challenges now faced by mobile app developers and their clients is getting potential users to actually download the app. If the app is a good quality, you should have no problem retaining your initial users, but there really is no point spending large amounts of money on branding, app design or development if you are unable to reach your target users.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we’re going to be putting together a series of posts on how to make your app visible to users and actually get them downloading your product. From today’s app store optimisation (ASO), social media strategies and how to secure yourself a guest blog post, we’ll be with you every step of the way to make sure your app gets the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>For tips when it comes to launching your app, check out one of our previous posts – <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/heres-why-launching-an-app-is-a-lot-like-speed-dating/">why you should treat your app launch like a first date</a>. It sounds bizarre but, trust us, this analogy works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Why is App Store Optimisation So Important?</u></strong></p>
<p>App store optimisation is the process of optimising mobile apps so that they rank higher on the app store’s search results. ASO will make your app visible to more people, therefore receiving more downloads. Optimising their app is something our clients so often neglect or ignore when they begin the process of mobile app development, occasionally leaving their apps to gather cobwebs, rendering all their (and our!) hard work on the development side completely useless.</p>
<p>According to research by Forrester, 63% of apps are found through searches on the app stores. Clearly, it is the best way to discover new apps, and it is how the majority of users find apps to download. Social media campaigns, blogging and content marketing obviously have their place when it comes to reaching new users, but ASO simply cannot be neglected. Spend time working on your ASO or, if you are short of time there are plenty of app development companies who will offer this service. It really is your secret weapon, investing energy into it will pay off big time when it comes to outranking the competition and securing those downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Where Do I Start?</u></p>
<p>The good news? App store optimisation is marginally less complex than search engine optimisation (SEO), The bad news? Realistically you will have to put time and resources into both to really make your app stand out, but that’s a topic for another post. For now, let’s discuss the crucial components of ASO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>App Store Or Play Store? </u></p>
<p>What works for the App Store will not have the same impact on the Play Store, and this is something that is consistently ignored when it comes to optimising your app. Some of the key differences between them are; app title character limit, description character limit and the influence of keywords in the app’s description. It is important to adapt your ASO based on whether your app is launching on Android or iOS, as they each have very different requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Keywords</u></p>
<p>Just like search engine optimisation, keywords are the basis of all app store searches. Find a decent keyword research tool such as <a href="https://www.appannie.com/">App Annie</a> which will help you discover high traffic keywords as well as various app rankings. During your branding stages either you or your app development company should have compiled a list of your competitors. These research tools can be used to work out which keywords your competitors are using, and help you choose the best keywords to optimise, in order to get your apps ranking higher than your competitors.</p>
<p>Keywords need to be <em>continuously </em>monitored and changed. It is not enough to write one description and think you are done. Update them, change them and test out different words and phrases (or, if you can’t be bothered – we’ll do it for you!).</p>
<p>You’ve got together your list of keywords, but how do you use them? This is where you need to consider your app and play store research, as they both have different requirements and therefore different ways to optimise. For both stores, we recommend incorporating appropriate keywords where you can, but beware of keyword stuffing. A mixture of long and short tail keywords will ensure you’re not cramming your description with the same keyword over and over. Not only does this look cheap and spammy to potential users; it may incur penalties or result in your app being suspended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Title</u></p>
<p>Your title needs to be short, snappy and informative. It needs to be creative, unique and in line with your brand values. Something that intrigues, informs and excites. Oh, and you also need a keyword in there. Easy right?</p>
<p>Research has shown that apps with a keyword in their title have an average of 10.3% ranking increase so make sure it’s a good’un. Go for one with the highest search traffic.</p>
<p>It is generally self-sabotaging to change your title– imagine if Instagram suddenly renamed themselves – so the title is extremely important.  If you’re going to spend a large amount of time on <em>anything, </em>it should be your title. Don’t get lost in the crowded app store, make sure you stand out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Description</u></p>
<p>Both the App Store and Play Store have different requirements when it comes to the description of your app. If your app is launched on the App Store, your description does not impact search rankings, therefore you can optimise it for <em>potential users only.</em></p>
<p>However, on the Google Play Store, the app’s description <em>is</em> taken into account when ranking your app. For this reason, it should be written with both users and the search engine in mind! Of course, it goes without saying that you should incorporate keywords into your description but try to make them flow naturally. Don’t get caught in the trap of neglecting your users in your description. No one and I repeat, <em>no one </em>is going to download your app if they can’t work out what it does because you’ve used all your allocated characters keyword stuffing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remember</u></p>
<p>ASO is a long process, it will take time and it needs to be monitored constantly. However, many app developers do little to no work on ASO and neglect to inform their clients that their apps may not be immediately visible to users on launch day. Because of this, even spending a few days focusing on your app store optimisation means you will be well ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>This, alongside the different marketing tricks and tips we will focus in later blog post, will ensure your app is visible in the app and play stores, attracts your target user base and <em>actually gets downloaded</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May it was revealed that nearly a quarter of people abandon an app after just one use. Launching an app that provides a positive experience for the user has never been more important, and it is essential that your mobile app developers draw on all available resources to make that initial contact as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>A user’s first interaction with your app is a lot like speed dating. You have approximately 2 minutes to make a good impression, to show off all your best qualities, and to avoid saying anything inappropriate.</p>
<p>Your mobile app developers are your matchmakers. Follow our advice and we’re confident your app and user will get off to a cracking start.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-boarding experience</span></p>
<p>If there is ever a time to make a good impression, this is it. If your date says something awkward or inappropriate, or the meeting just isn’t as smooth as you’d anticipated, recovery is difficult. There is, of course, still a chance for your app to make up for it, but, like an awkward first date, it will need to <em>really </em>excel in other areas to stop the classic ‘emergency phone call’ we are all guilty of inventing.</p>
<p>On-boarding doesn’t have to be hugely complicated. In fact, sometimes it’s best if you and your app developers keep it simple. A few basic (but aesthetically pleasing) screens highlighting what the app does and how to use it is enough.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to provide users with a ‘skip’ button because there are still people in the world who refuse to read the instructions and these are the people whose IKEA furniture ends up looking like this…</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ikea11.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-491 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ikea11-1024x681.jpg" alt="mobile app developers" width="1024" height="681" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy</span></p>
<p>Privacy concerns are becoming more and more prevalent when it comes to technology, and users will no longer sit back, oblivious to what happens to their data as we did in the good old Bebo days.</p>
<p>Apps which automatically post to social media accounts (embarrassing), pass on data to third parties or track geolocation without permission are a big no no. Ensure your app only asks for geolocation permission if and when it needs it<em>. </em>If your app cannot function without geolocation tracking that’s fine, but make sure the user knows this.</p>
<p>Again, think of this as like a first date. It’s all going well and then BAM, your date asks for your address and social media handles. Oh, and they also plant a tracker on your body.It’s weird, it’s inappropriate, and someone will probably end up getting hurt.</p>
<p>Ensure all privacy policies are clear, visible and easy to understand, and clearly state when signing in via social media that this does <em>not </em>allow the app to post to the user’s social media accounts without permission. Essentially, be clear about why your app needs the users’ data, and if the app doesn’t need it, don’t ask for it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cluttered with ads</span></p>
<p>Don’t prioritise short-term cash through ad revenue in favour of user loyalty.</p>
<p>Banner ads often block the content of the app which will raise the average user’s frustration levels to a solid 11 out of 10, especially if the close button is difficult to find. The ads detract from the whole app experience, are infuriating and more often than not, have absolutely nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>Forcing users to pay for the premium version of the app in order to remove adverts will do little for your user loyalty. You would never date someone solely for their money (well, we hope you wouldn’t), and users don’t like to feel that you are taking advantage of them and their spare 75p.</p>
<p>Alternatives to bombarding users with costly options to remove ads are to find a constructive way to offer in-app purchases that genuinely enhance the experience. Alternatively, present adverts in the way Facebook or Instagram does, non-intrusive and displayed in a way that doesn’t force the user to interact with, or even look at them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical flaws and bugs</span></p>
<p>As mobile app developers, we know how frustrating it can be when an app has a technical flaw or bugs, but if there’s one thing we want our clients to know, it’s that it’s <em>impossible </em>to completely eliminate them. So try not to get upset with your developers when Apple updates their software and suddenly your app doesn’t run properly.</p>
<p>Whilst techie glitches do occasionally occur, it is important to make sure that for the initial launch everything is running as smoothly as possible. If your date was constantly sneezing or coughing you would probably call it off fairly early, well, it’s the same with your app. Your app developers need to ensure your app is bug free, runs smoothly and doesn’t sneeze on anyone.</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth launch of a product we recommend that you put in place two safe guards, one a rigorous quality assurance process where expected outcomes are tested against actual outcomes. For example, if the specification says a user should be able to post a photo, add a comment and then later edit it &#8211; you should test this exact process with your beta version whilst documenting any bugs or graphical elements that are not the expected result.</p>
<p>Secondly we recommend doing a limited initial release, think friends and family, friends of friends &#8211; just enough to stress the platform into revealing any underlying bugs that were not discovered during the QA process. This pre-launch-launch ensures that you don’t release a platform to the wider public only to discover the backend has a mental breakdown when your app reaches 1000 users.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fishing for compliments</span></p>
<p>Make sure your app isn’t too needy. Constantly asking for ratings or reviews is only going to annoy your user, in the same way adverts will. Forcing them to rate your app whilst they are in the middle of using it is a sure fire way to get your app thrown away like yesterday’s leftover lunch.</p>
<p>Instead of breaking their flow, ask them to rate your app when they have actually achieved something and are feeling positive, not in the middle of the activity. Make sure you provide a ‘Do not ask me again’ option and ensure it&#8217;s easy for the user to rate. Remember, we are all lazy.</p>
<p>The way we usually set it up is to have a prompt asking, “Have you been enjoying using X so far?”. If the user says yes, ask “do you mind giving us a rating on the App Store?” with an option for either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;Don’t remind me again&#8221;. If the user clicks yes, the App Store will launch. If the user replies they do not enjoy using the app (although if they’ve been using it for this long, they probably just want to get rid of the prompt), simply say &#8220;Thanks for your feedback&#8221;. Job done, with no fishes in sight.</p>
<p><u>Where did it all go wrong?</u></p>
<p>Alas, sometimes your user and your app just don&#8217;t click, But there are still options for you. App analytics can be used to track page views and app events such as button clicks. It can be used to ascertain which features work or don&#8217;t work, as well as seeing which part of the sign up users might be dropping off at. Once the problem parts of the app have been identified, for example a specific on-boarding screen, your app developers can run A/B tests to see if improving that specific screen leads to an increase in engagement and less drop offs.</p>
<p>Like a first date, that initial contact can make or break the relationship between app and user, so it&#8217;s important to get it right. But remember, there are always improvements that can be made, no matter what the initial user response. Even the apps that dominate the App Store release updates and new features on a regular basis. And if, at the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t work out with some users, there&#8217;s plenty more fish in the sea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many of us, it&#8217;s the beginning of the end of our time on the social media phenomenon, Facebook. I’m not talking of deleting our accounts of course, it’s unlikely we would resort to that, although the thought does regularly cross my mind. I’m talking of realising that scrolling through Facebook is no longer an acceptable pastime. We’re bored of adverts, we rarely upload photos and we can’t even remember the last time we wrote ‘Happy Birthday’ on a loose acquaintance’s wall. Or wrote anything on anyone’s wall for that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the younger generation are starting to become ‘passive’ users. We use Facebook to sign into other apps, to remove ‘friends’ who aren’t actually friends or occasionally share an interesting article. But according to reports, we do little else. Active engagement is in decline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Making the platform personal </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April this year a 21% decline in ‘original sharing’ was reported. People are posting less and although user engagement and time spent on the platform continues to rise, it is the personal content and connections with friends that made the platform so addictive for millennials in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report published by Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg discussed in a recent meeting ways to encourage more personal sharing, in order to meet and counteract this drop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature ‘On This Day’ was launched last year displaying our Facebook posts from the same day each year before As someone who spent their teenage years posting their entire life on Facebook, this feature is generally the only thing I look at if I log onto Facebook in the morning. I am usually left red-faced, spending the majority of my morning deleting status’ from 2008 in which I moan about either my parents or the amount of homework I have to do, praying I don&#8217;t accidentally &#8216;like&#8217; anything and have it jump to the top of all my friends&#8217; News Feeds. Cringe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The re-engagement attempts do not stop there. Trying to encourage personal posts about relationships, Facebook now reminds us of special occasions like Mother’s Day. It’s also easier than ever to post pictures, as your camera roll displays photos taken that day at the top of our News Feeds. Of course this has instilled panic in millions of people as they assume Facebook has actually posted their private photos. Because which of your Facebook friends actually wants to see a picture of what you had for breakfast? Instagram followers however, that’s another matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More new features &#8211; Facebook now tells you the weather in your specific town &#8211; not even your general area but actual town. It also wishes you personally a good morning when you log in before breakfast.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Facebook know too much?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Are these constant updates simply making Facebook look a bit…desperate? Facebook is a place <em>for </em>friends, it’s not supposed to actually <em>be </em>my friend. I’d rather it didn’t say, ‘Good morning Alex!’ with a weather update in my hometown as soon as I wake up because, quite frankly, it’s a bit creepy. It’s possible this is another reason why people are abandoning the platform, or at least limiting their posting. We are finally realising how much of our life exists on the internet, and subsequently, how much Facebook actually <em>knows </em>about us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Facebook knows. It knows a lot. It knows what we did at the weekend, where we spent our summer holiday, what websites we have looked at recently, which apps we have downloaded, what we wore to a house party in 2011 and how we felt about our biology homework in 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days, we are more clued up over internet dangers. We know the damage a drunken photo from your night out in Sheffield can do in a job interview, and maybe we’re just no longer comfortable sharing our personal views and family photos with 2000 ‘friends’, of whom we only personally know 90.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Older generations</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally it was just the millennials on Facebook. The social media savvies, uploading their last few photos of their weekend ignorant to the dangers of the web whilst their unsuspecting parents tell them to get off the computer so they can use the phone.  Facebook was the go-to place to hang out after school. With Facebook, you could spend time with your friends from the comfort of your living room, and didn’t have to spend 12p on a text every time you wanted to get in touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s platforms like Pinterest (coincidentally Facebook-owned), Instagram and Snapchat that inspire excitement in the younger generation. They are newer, trendier, and the best part? Our posts won’t be hung out to dry for a decade’s accumulation of friends to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For millennials, Facebook may soon become old fashioned and outdated. As the older generations realise the fun to be had on the platform, it&#8217;ll soon be full of distant relatives you haven’t seen since you were eight, writing comments the length of an email about how they ‘must get over to visit the family soon’ on a photo of you and your friends. Embarrassing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, does anyone actually want their nan to see their weekend antics?  Research has shown that a third of younger internet users admitted to actually deleting social media accounts because their parents had signed up. Evidently making your account private and rejecting their friend request is just too cruel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parents are joining us, and the grandparents, the distant relatives, even the pets. There’s nothing more disconcerting than seeing a friend request from your dog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oldies have joined the party and they are discovering the joys of reconnecting with old friends, whilst simultaneously keeping an eye on their children’s online, and offline, behaviour. Think your teenager has been misbehaving? Take a look at their Facebook page, there’s no doubt it’ll be on there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Facebook for businesses</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about the role of Facebook for your company? Of course it’s important your business has a Facebook page to build a loyal following, but there are alternative options opening up for companies to market their products. Many users may have become immune to the sponsored posts and adverts littering our Facebook newsfeeds, automatically scrolling past them without actually reading, and it is only spending large amounts of money running ad campaigns that marketers are actually able to see results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet platforms like Instagram and Snapchat have opened a whole new window of opportunities for companies, with organisations recently catching on to their potential. The platforms are growing more and more, and due to the lack of links, the two retain a luxuriously clean, anti-spam feel, a feeling Facebook no longer has with it’s cluttered newsfeed and deviation from the personal to the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram is generating good engagement and the average Instagram user is younger than the average Facebook user, a factor which generally drives higher ad prices. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-ads-worth-more-than-facebook-2015-9?IR=T">Business Insider</a> reported soon after the integration of ads into Instagram that the average price per ad impression on Instagram was 90% higher than on Facebook. Users are actually clicking on the ads, perhaps because they take up a lot more space on our screen alongside the fact we aren’t actually used to seeing ads on Instagram, unlike the constant bombardment that occurs on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An average conversion on Instagram is likely worth more in future sales than on Facebook. Although partly due to the novelty of Instagram ads, meaning the success is likely unsustainable, it seems unlikely that Facebook conversion rates are going to catch up even when Instagram’s success dies down.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The end?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Despite these factors, it’s doubtful Facebook is going to die out just yet and, even if it does they still have Instagram to fall back on. Facebook is deeply engrained in our lives and the On This Day feature reminds any doubters of this on a daily basis. We use our accounts to sign into other apps, and have seemingly accepted that Facebook privacy is a thing of the past, the platform is now more public and wide-reaching than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook still remains the primary source of communication, and the place that news stories, opinions and videos of cats spread within seconds. If we actually went as far as to delete our accounts, do we really know what would be deleted? I’m sure I’m not the only one who finds Facebook’s privacy policies rather vague. Perhaps it’s best to continue to visit it each morning, monitoring what goes online with our name attached to it whilst simultaneously enjoying the freedom Facebook does offer, reading long, pretentious debates about politics between your friends. Evidently, it’s better to be safe than sorry, and no one wants to be haunted by <em>that </em>photo for the rest of our professional lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been keeping on top of the news this weekend then you won’t have missed the phenomenon currently dominating the digital world – Pokémon GO (if you have missed it then you can read our tech news round up <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/5-things-you-should-know-about-this-week/">here</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The augmented reality game, launched last Wednesday in Australia and the U.S, has already increased the value of Nintendo by $7.5 billion and the market capitalisation now stands at around $28 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just two days after the launch, the game was installed on 5.16% of Android devises, a huge amount, especially when compared to leading dating app Tinder, installed on 2%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps even more impressive, Pokémon GO looks set to beat Twitter’s daily active users. Last Friday, Pokémon GO had 3% of daily active Android users, not far from Twitter’s 3.5%, and it’s only going to keep growing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retaining the basics of past Pokémon games, Pokémon GO allows users to battle at Gyms, catch Pokémon and evolve your creatures. But, unlike past Pokémon games, Pokémon GO occurs in the real world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game superimposes Pokémon over your actual location using your smartphone camera. By physically walking around your area, the avatar moves along the map on your phone using GPS. Places with the most Pokémon are usually populated areas such as tourist spots or shopping centres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save players from walking into oncoming traffic with their eyes glued to their phone (although this has still happened), the phone will vibrate when a Pokémon is nearby and, once you spot it via your camera, you throw a Poké Ball to try to capture it. Players can collect other items, evolve their Pokémon and visit ‘Gyms’, where they join teams and battle with other players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why has Pokémon GO had such incredible initial success?  Or perhaps more importantly, what can start ups, marketers and<a href="http://borneagency.com/"> app developers </a>learn from this success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s delve a little deeper into what has made Pokémon GO so successful and what we, as marketers or app developers ourselves can learn from it’s launch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nostalgia Works</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing is clear from the launch of Pokémon GO, nostalgia works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why create something brand new when you can simply relaunch something so many people crave?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst appealing to the audience&#8217;s nostalgia may not be relevant for your specific business, there is still a lesson that can be learned from this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most notably, the concept of tuning into your customers’ emotions. One of the reasons why Pokémon GO has been so successful initially is because it ignites memories in millennials. Memories of collecting Pokémon cards at school, watching Ash and Pikachu in the anime series and memories of childhood adventure without the stresses of adulthood. Pokémon GO allows players to revisit old favourites with an extremely modern twist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As humans, we are naturally nostalgic. Companies have caught onto this and integrated nostalgia into their marketing campaigns. Mars Inc. revived Crispy M&amp;M’s with their ‘Crispy Is Back’ campaign, and Coca-Cola are the kings of nostalgic marketing with their current plastic bottles mirroring their old school glass ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bardofboston">Erik Devaney</a> writes extensively on <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/nostalgia-marketing#sm.0000028cma0zw7d77tfbjm39ytuxm">nostalgic marketing campaigns</a> and how companies can leverage the past in order to encourage consumers to buy. Essentially, if your content can make people feel nostalgic, a whole host of other effects will follow, including enhanced mood, increased self-esteem, social connectedness and feelings of positivity. Get people feeling like this and your chances of sales will skyrocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Fear Of Missing Out</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being successful at Pokémon GO requires more than just wandering around town hoping to spot some Pokémon. There’s only so many Pokémon that can be found in a specific area, meaning the app actually encourages users to get out and get exploring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fear of missing out is a key feature when it comes to Pokémon GO’s supposed addictiveness. People don’t want to miss out on certain Pokémon just because they don’t live in the right place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game encourages people to explore further afield than their hometown, to keep exploring and constantly search for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketers are regularly creating this sense of urgency with their campaigns. Special events and spot sales which occur only in a few regions spark a fear in people, that what they currently have is not enough and they have to reach further afield to achieve more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Igniting a fear of missing out has become a highly successful method of marketing. We assume people are enjoying life more than us. According to psychologists, irrational thoughts like these lead to irrational behaviours – such as impulse buying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson? Your marketing efforts should elicit feelings of exclusivity in your customers. Make your product feel exclusive and treat your current customers as though they’re part of a special club. Do this and you can be sure that others will go out of their way to join it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Limited </u><u>release</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less is more when it comes to marketing, and this is something which has worked brilliantly for Pokémon GO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game, currently only available in the U.S, Australia and New Zealand, has delayed it’s UK and international release date as the demand to play it is so high. The surge in people trying to play has actually broken the servers which power Pokémon GO, meaning the UK and international release has been ‘paused’, until the company is sure that it will work properly for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst we wouldn’t recommend deliberately attempting to break servers with marketing campaigns, chances are, having to wait a little longer for a product is only going to increase the hype surrounding it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anticipation is key when it comes to launching your product. Leave something for your customers to get excited about. If it’s an app that you are launching, this means not showing your whole hand straight away. Keep something extra up your sleeve for Version 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When marketing your product, give potential customers sneak peaks such as screenshots on social media or details about what you will provide. Excite your users with just a snippet of what you can offer and you will certainly see an increase in downloads or purchases when it comes to launch date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The New Gaming</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s so great about Pokémon GO and it’s immense initial success is that it encourages an entirely different form of gaming. We generally think of &#8216;gamers&#8217; as teenagers sat alone in dark rooms with their social skills depleting as rapidly as the zombies they’re shooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pokémon GO inspires something completely new and, ironically, it could be a game that helps America’s obesity epidemic. People are flocking to Twitter to share stories of sore legs and feet from running to catch their Pokémon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is exercising whilst gaming, something virtually unheard of until now. After all the research, it turns out it’s not the fear of diabetes that gets people off the sofa, it’s the knowledge that there may be a Pokémon just a short jog away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now gamers are getting outside and exploring. Yes, they may be searching for animated monsters via their mobile phones, but anything that gets such as huge number of people outdoors can only be a good thing. Although clearly there is a dark side to this new found liberation, as one unlucky girl <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36757858/pokemon-go-player-finds-dead-body-in-wyoming-river-while-searching-for-a-pokestop">stumbled across a dead body</a>, whilst robbers have used the app to lure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/10/pokemon-go-armed-robbers-dead-body">victims into remote locations.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of these unfortunate experiences, Nintendo has done something few have done before. They have created a product completely original, opening a whole new world that combines the digital with reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As app developers we are constantly encouraging people to figure out what they can do differently, how they can make their product stand out in the ever expanding app store. Use your imagination, take risks and do something different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy the game or not, I think we can all agree that Pokémon GO’s launch has been spot-on and their overwhelming success provides lessons we can all learn from.</p>
