				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a global spend set to reach $2 trillion in 2023 digital transformation has become more than just a buzz term that is banded around at every management get together. To me it is both a process and an outcome that provides both challenges and opportunities in equal measure.</p>
<p>Business leaders are all clambering around trying to align on their digital transformation strategies desperate to increase efficiencies across their business through digital and embrace technology better throughout their organisations.</p>
<p>We are fortunate enough at <a href="http://borneagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Borne</a> to see both sides as we work with disruptive start ups as well as enterprise clients so have insights into both the ‘disrupter’ and the ‘disrupted’ so to speak. 67% of business leaders think that their companies will no longer be competitive in 2020 if they do not address and adapt to change and become more digitized. But what does digital transformation actually mean for the larger business and how should they be looking at things?</p>
<p><strong>The corporate challenge</strong></p>
<p>I personally think that corporates should take a step back and look at the business much like a start up looks at their product when in the very early product ideation phase. Simply looking at a HR problem for instance and stating ‘we need to use AI to….’ is for me using tech for the sake of using tech. I think it’s important to evaluate what problem it is that the business needs to address. Be it a consumer or in house staff issue, you start with that problem. If the problem is retention then fine – perhaps look into an employee wellness or onboarding app, but don’t just ‘build an app’ for your employees without a clear goal of what problem it’s addressing.</p>
<p>It’s important to get into the mindsets of the employees within the organisation on a granular level in order to fully integrate them into whatever transformative process you are going through.</p>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGVK19xxHMgPQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1579132800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9G0myhIz1KrR73qlzZGN_jOXr3K_TIV8EiC3Bk4xglg" alt="No alt text provided for this image" width="1001" height="440" /></div>
<p>I think it’s necessary to look at how technology within an organisation can first improve the health and wellbeing of those within it rather than looking at how it will affect the bottom line. The theory being that if you get your internal transformative process correct the bottom line with take care of itself as a result. Of course there are transformation strategies that companies should look to adopt in order to better reach consumers and engage better but ultimately the consumer doesn’t care about the strategies, they care about the end product. I’ll write a bit more about this in a separate post.</p>
<p><strong>Employees First</strong></p>
<p>Getting employees on board and addressing concerns upfront will certainly alleviate concerns and increase buy in. Commons concerns such as:</p>
<p>&#8211;      Am I going to be replaced by a robot</p>
<p>&#8211;      Will I still have a job in 2 years</p>
<p>&#8211;      What if I don’t get on board with change?</p>
<p>&#8211;      Will this affect my day to day duties</p>
<p>These are all very common issues organisations will face and tackling these head on and at the start of any transformative process and having employees lead this process will make them feel part of it and also better shape the transformation. Consider it a User Experience gathering workshop for a new product, just with employees rather than end users.</p>
<p><strong>The end game</strong></p>
<p>So what does this mean for the corporates? To start with, it’s about embracing technology and using it’s efficiencies to best engage and support those within the organisation. Be it a technology ‘ally’ that offers support or services to employees such as food delivery or childcare to an in house CRM/HR platform that harnesses data fed to it from employees via an app that asks questions around general wellbeing and happiness at work. It’s all about support, enabling and having a growth mindset.</p>
<p><u>Creating a grassroots culture of digitisation is critical for change to not only be embraced, but for it to be successful.</u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="e7bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s January, and we all know what that means. It’s time to dig out our now-too-small workout gear and join the hundreds of others with the same idea, angrily sweating their way through a workout in a gym that strongly resembles a tin of miserable, treadmill-pounding sardines. It’s goodbye morning bacon butties and hello kale, green juices or perhaps, if you’re really committed, veganuary.</h4>
<hr />
<p id="8348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’ll all be worth it when we get our dream body, we say to ourselves on January 2nd, miserably forking salad leaves into our mouths and trying not to think about the leftover Christmas chocolate at the back of the kitchen cupboard.</p>
<p id="3bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">New Year’s resolutions are notoriously hard to stick to, but with the mince pies, baileys and those seven large plates of turkey curry wolfed down between Boxing Day and January, ‘lose weight’ is the obvious choice of resolution for most people. But with 80% of New Year’s resolutions failing by the second week of February, it’s easy to think that achieving our weight loss goals simply isn’t on the cards for us.</p>
<h5>The Rise of Fitness Tech</h5>
<p id="b22e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Technology makes our lives easier in so many ways. We can order dinner via our smartphones. We can book a taxi, make a reservation, check the status of a flight. We can forget our wallets and know that it’s no biggie. We can pay off our debts and we can track our water intake. Hell, we can even check out our ex’s cousin’s housemate’s holiday album from his trip to Croatia back in 2011. And now? Now we can lose weight.</p>
<p id="30ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alright, so we still need to exercise and eat healthily. These are tech products, not plastic surgery coupons. But if you’re serious about your New Year’s diet, take your pick from our favourite fitness tech look set to hit the mainstream in 2018.</p>
<h5>Group Heart Rate Tracking</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" data-width="759" data-height="508" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" data-scroll="native"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" alt="mobile app developers uk" width="759" height="508" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UmK8coL4VHvrgvlgAVbnIg.png" /></div>
</div>
<p id="c2ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Or, as we like to call it, The Spin Class from Hell</p>
<p id="c01c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, so we’re not really selling it, but we can certainly see the appeal. Gyms are now using technology to track members’ heart rates, calorie burn and training zones, displaying the results on a screen at the front of their fitness classes.</p>
<p id="1bfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does this mean for your weight loss efforts? Well, it means that everyone in your fitness class can see if you’re being lazy.</p>
<p id="0a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gone are the days when you could turn your spin bike back down to level 1 if you needed a little time out; it’s now clear as day who’s slacking.</p>
<p id="c89e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To us, this sounds like a living nightmare. But if you know you’ve got a competitive streak and want to see how you’re faring against other gym-goers, this could be the technology that brings out the best in you.</p>
<h5 id="bcd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual Reality &amp; Augmented Reality</h5>
<p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qymvSJkGeuu9awBallyzkA.png" alt="augmented reality app developers uk" width="800" height="446" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qymvSJkGeuu9awBallyzkA.png" /></p>
<p id="4967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Both virtual and augmented reality can play a part in helping you to shed some pounds this January. Remember the inspiring weight loss stories that sprung from Pokémon GO? No? Us neither. But we’re sure there were some.</p>
<p id="cacd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pokémon GO took the notion that you can’t exercise and game at the same time and turned it on its head. Gamers are no longer seen as lazy, pre-pubescents who spend all day in a dark room throwing insults at other gamers on the other side of the world. They’re more than happy to get outside in the fresh air if they have enough incentive.</p>
<p id="0946" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual reality in the fitness industry comes in many forms and is guaranteed to grow in 2018 (while hopefully helping us to shrink). Firstly, there’s the games. Two standouts for us are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://vr.fruitninja.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://vr.fruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/528550/Drunkn_Bar_Fight/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/528550/Drunkn_Bar_Fight/">Drunken Bar Fight</a>. While the name ‘Drunken Bar Fight’ doesn’t exactly scream ‘New Year, New Me’, its novel and unconventional way of encouraging exercise could just be what keeps us going.</p>
<p id="7cfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Fruit Ninja involves using virtual Samurai swords to chop up flying fruit, Drunken Bar Fight encourages users to punch and throw things, gaining strength as they drink more alcohol. It’s certainly unusual, but if it burns calories then we’re not complaining.</p>
<p id="73a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtual reality is also being used in gyms to make running on the treadmill less boring. In 2015, Hong Kong gym <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.pure-fitness.com/hongkong/page/view/immersive_fitness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.pure-fitness.com/hongkong/page/view/immersive_fitness">Pure Fitness</a> invested £250,000 on ‘immersive fitness’ — a purpose-built studio featuring a 270-degree VR screen.</p>
<h5 id="3f67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Powerdot</h5>
<p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EvlcPrQSG_Dbatn2mKWufA.png" alt="app developers uk powerdot" width="617" height="564" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EvlcPrQSG_Dbatn2mKWufA.png" /></p>
<p id="1e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.powerdot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.powerdot.com/">Powerdot</a> is an electric muscle stimulation device, which promises to activate your muscle fibres at any stage of your workout — before, during or after. It may look like a torture machine (and it probably feels like one too), but the Powerdot promises to decrease muscle tension, increase blood flow, improves muscle strength and prepare muscles for training — depending on which ‘workout’ you select.</p>
<p id="0198" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using the Powerdot app, users can select the muscle group they’d most like to target, and the Powerdot will then send electrical impulses to that part of their body.</p>
<p id="12a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The product costs a hefty £274.99, but if your January DOMS are almost too much to bear, it might just be worth it.</p>
<h5 id="afdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">MUHDO Genetic Profiling</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aZ56YTu2E2EFBHFahQjJHA.png" alt="muhdo app developers uk" width="800" height="564" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aZ56YTu2E2EFBHFahQjJHA.png" /></div>
<p id="09b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If strapping an electrical muscle stimulation device to your chest seems a little OTT, perhaps you’re better suited to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://muhdo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://muhdo.com/">MUHDO</a>. Using advanced and comprehensive genetic profiling, MUHDO creates personalised health and fitness plans based on your unique gene functions.</p>
<p id="719f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So how does it work? Well, your genetic data is analysed by experts, who then create a detailed report and personalised health and fitness plan. The plan is tailored to you; based on your specific goals and unique DNA. They also provide ongoing support, information and inspiration, giving you the best possible chance of achieving your health and fitness goals.</p>
<p id="db33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only downside is that you’ll still need to exercise and eat well, but that pretty much goes without saying when it comes to getting in shape. If you’ve got a spare £249.99 then what have you got to lose? — aside from those pesky pounds.</p>
<h5 id="3ea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fitbit Iconic</h5>
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignnone" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bnDZVD_pVuE3PotRRUE_dA.png" alt="fitbit iconic app developers " width="493" height="431" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bnDZVD_pVuE3PotRRUE_dA.png" /></div>
</div>
<p id="50a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We’re well aware that only a year ago we wrote a piece heavily questioning the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">accuracy and effectiveness of wearable fitness trackers</a> like the market leading Fitbit but hey, we’re still here and still chubby so maybe it’s time to give it another go.</p>
<p id="15a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.fitbit.com/ionic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.fitbit.com/ionic">Iconic</a> is Fitbit’s latest attempt to get the nation exercising. It features dynamic personal coaching, the ability to both store and play music without the use of a smartphone, a built-in GPS, heart rate tracker and multi-sport analysis.</p>
<p id="a60e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Iconic certainly feels a bit more ‘smartwatch-y’ than its predecessors, and for this reason we’re willing to give it a try. The downside? It costs £239.00. However, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Ionic-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Smoke/dp/B074KBP5RV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514974432&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fitbit+iconic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Ionic-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Smoke/dp/B074KBP5RV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514974432&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fitbit+iconic">Amazon</a> are on hand to save our waistlines as they’ve put it on sale for £239. Time to start training.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Our favourite time of year has come round again! It&#8217;s time to settle down with a glass of Pimms and spend the next two weeks pretending to be a tennis expert from the comfort of your sofa (or actually go to Wimbledon if you&#8217;re organised).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our favourite time of year has come round again! It&#8217;s time to settle down with a glass of Pimms and spend the next two weeks pretending to be a tennis expert from the comfort of your sofa (or actually go to Wimbledon if you&#8217;re organised).</p>
<p>Last year we wrote a <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/wimbledon-new-technology/">post</a> all about the technology used at our favourite summer event, and this year we have decided to do the same (thoughts on making this an annual thing?). The technology used at Wimbledon does a great job of showing just how much the industry is growing, and we can&#8217;t help but wonder what 2020 might bring!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our quick roundup of all the fancy tech you can experience at both the courts and at home &#8211; when you&#8217;re not sipping pimms or celeb-spotting that is.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ask Fred</span></p>
<p>Enabled by IBM Watson, Ask Fred is the Wimbledon chatbot, available to attendees via the Wimbledon app.</p>
<p>Ask Fred will be able to answer a variety of questions, from where to eat or drink to where to buy a Wimbledon towel (priorities). Three public WIFI hotspots have also been added to the grounds which is great for those of us who tend to use up all our data sending smug Snapchats to our desk-bound friends.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Artificial Intelligence</span></p>
<p>IBM have delved into the world of artificial intelligence this year, introducing an AI-powered system which was tested at the 2017 Masters golf tournament in April.</p>
<p>The system will create a &#8216;cognitive highlight&#8217; reel after each game, based on what it deems the most exciting and dramatic moments of the tournament.</p>
<p>In past years, the post-match highlight reel would have to be manually selected by a producer monitoring the footage, so this is a big step up for the AELTC. The technology will make its decisions based on several factors such as the number of aces played, speed of the ball and breakpoints, but it will also analyse human behaviour. Loud cheering and reactions from a player which are different to their norm (it will also have access to past matches) will be noted. The clips are then ranked and formed into a two-minute highlight video, available to viewers approximately 30 minutes after each match.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Augmented Reality</span></p>
<p>If you fancy getting up close and personal with your favourite players then this next one is for you &#8211; as the club will be unveiling  a 360-degree video of the Wimbledon practise courts!</p>
<p>Visitors and fans will be able to get a detailed insight into how the players warm up and practise, while also discovering more about their favourite players. This &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; technology looks set to be a huge hit with hardcore tennis fans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Makes Great?</span></p>
<p>Another technology set to wow the public this year is IBM&#8217;s &#8216;What Makes Great&#8217; solution.</p>
<p>The technology uses historical data to identify key performance measures against a set of topics required to make a great champion. Providing fans with far more than just various tennis skills, What Makes Great wlll take into account mental attributes such as passion and performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Analysing over 50 million tennis points ranging as far back as 1990, over 6000 newspaper articles and 11 million words worth of social media commentary, What Makes Great is for anyone who&#8217;s interested in what makes a great tennis player and for anyone who fancies themselves as a Wimbledon champion in the future!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology In Sport</span></p>
<p>Advances in technology are having a profound impact on the way the public experience large sporting events, and it&#8217;s great to see it happen first hand through an event as exciting as Wimbledon.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s Wordwide Developers Conference kicked off yesterday and the event was, as expected, filled to the brim with new features, major announcements and not-so-subtle attempts to put Google back in their place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of the event so far:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HomePod</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Apple&#8217;s Siri speaker is finally here (well, in December).</p>
<p>It looks like an old Mac Pro, stands at a modest 7 inches tall and is powered by the A8 chipset. Users can use it in the same way they would Amazon Echo or Google Home, but Apple&#8217;s HomePod has a few little extras to make it stand out.</p>
<p>HomePod uses the A8 chip to monitor the space in the room and change its sound accordingly. The &#8216;Musicologist&#8217; feature works alongside Apple Music and can be accessed by talking to Siri &#8211; who can now handle complicated questions, play music on demand or send iMessages..</p>
<p>It will be available in black and white, and costs $349. A valiant effort but so far we can&#8217;t see it knocking Echo off the top spot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iOS 11</span></p>
<p>This is a big one for us as, let&#8217;s face it, we could spend hours exploring Apple&#8217;s latest iOS updates. Like every year, Apple showcased their latest iOS update and got the tongues wagging of mobile app developers all around the globe.</p>
<p>Packed full of new features, iOS 11 definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Siri&#8217;s voice is now much less robotic thanks to machine learning, and it&#8217;ll use on-device learning to improve users&#8217; iOS experiences. Siri will also speak in another language for you, which is great news for the 80% of Brits who communicate with non-English speakers by speaking English with a slightly foreign accent.</p>
<p>Siri is also learning to predict the users&#8217; next moves and will offer suggestions based on previous behaviours. It&#8217;ll learn interests, suggest related topics in News or will add related words to QuickType suggestions.</p>
<p>Other features in iOS 11 include the addition of person-to-person payments in Apple Pay and the ability to send money through iMessages. Photos and videos will take up less space, and a long exposure mode is being added to the camera. Apple Maps will be updated with lane guidance and speed limits displayed, as well as indoor maps of department stores. Users will be able to see what their friends are listening to on Apple Music (this has the potential to be mildly embarrassing), and the App Store is getting a total redesign and will look a lot more similar to the current layout of Apple Music.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WatchOS 4</span></p>
<p>Apple are adding several new faces, including a Siri face to the WatchOS 4. This face will automatically display the information which is most important to you and simply lifting your wrist will display this relevant information. This face will provide traffic information, reminders, news headlines and other location/time specific information.</p>
<p>The activity app is also getting updated. New workout challenges will be added, alongside a high intensity interval training mode. While we&#8217;re sceptical about the actual usefulness of fitness watches (read more <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">here</a>), we&#8217;re glad to see Apple doing their bit to combat the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>However the most exciting feature of the WatchOS 4 is the Toy Story-related watchfaces. The new faces will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz Lightyear, and if that&#8217;s not the best piece of techie news you&#8217;ve heard this year than you need to take a long hard look at yourself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacOS 10.13 High Sierra</span></p>
<p>Although a bit of a mouthful, the new version of macOS has a number of useful improvements. Photos will be easier to sort through, with Apple allowing users to filter them by order or tag. Photo editor will also be much more user friendly, with new tools available such as Curve. Updates to Safari will help to block site trackers &#8211; meaning you won&#8217;t be plagued with headphone adverts for 10 months after you&#8217;ve actually bought the headphones.</p>
<p>Updates also include Apple&#8217;s new file system, APFS, which will make moving files around much quicker and simultaneously free up space.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.5 Inch iPad Pro </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually software that is announced at the WWDCs, so whenever a new piece of hardware is introduced, our app developers and designers will spend the next few days deciding who&#8217;s going to take one for the team and buy it first.</p>
<p>This year, Apple introduced the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro, featuring a 12-megapixel camera and a 7-megapixel selfie camera, alongside 10 hours of battery life. The large screen allows for a full size onscreen keyboard and it also supports HBR video. Apple Pencil will be more responsive thanks to the new ProMotion feature &#8211; which increases the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz.</p>
<p>Finally it features a six-core A10X Fusion Chip with a 30% CPU performance improvement and a 40% graphics improvement. Notes has a built in document scanner and tapping with the Apple Pencil will lead you directly to the Notes app.</p>
<p>The 10.5-inch iPAd Pro will start at 64GB and costs $649.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iMac Update</span></p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s updated the iMac line which has gone down a storm with our app designers who are already whipping out their credit cards while committing themselves to a life of porridge and packed lunches. The new line includes an iMac 21.50inch and iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inc, with better storage, screens and the latest Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen processors.</p>
<p>The latest iMacs are shipping now but don&#8217;t be too hasty, as Apple also announced the high-end iMac Pro with with a Space Grey finish, a 27-inch screen, 18 cores in its processor and 16GB of VRAM. Start saving!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the team at Borne Digital love just as much as tech, it&#8217;s food. We are a bunch of foodies and instead of visiting the usual chains at lunch, we like to branch out. Friday lunchtime sees us exploring new street food stalls and trying as many different meals as we can. Whether it&#8217;s tacos, Brazilian BBQs, Thai curries or falafel wraps &#8211; between us we have probably eaten every cuisine in London!</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before we decided to combine our love of street food with mobile app development. We realised there was actually very little in the way of apps to point us to new and exciting street food. So, we took matters into our own hands and began to brainstorm ideas for our latest in-house app, Streats.</p>
<p>We swiftly hired Content Manager Charlie, who has that rare talent of making a photo of a 3 day old pizza look appetising. He&#8217;s a true whizz behind a camera and has worked for a street food YouTube channel back in Sydney. With an (albeit small) team in place, it was time to get started on the content.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Curation</span></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to get this project launched in time for Spring, the time of the year when everyone emerges from their dark offices filled with hope, only to be blinded by the sunlight and burnt to a crisp in approximately 6 minutes. If there is ever a time to launch an app for Londoners, it&#8217;s in line with warmer weather, some short-lived optimism and the termination of January&#8217;s no-carb diet.</p>
<p>For this reason, we had to be speedy. Charlie headed out every day on his bike to visit the various markets around our area of London. He photographed the delicious food, chatted to the stall owners, heard the stories and inspiration behind their creations and, of course, tasted a <em>lot </em>of food.</p>
<p>Once Charlie had covered the markets in East Central, we began heading further afield, while simultaneously putting the content together for the app &#8211; editing the photos and writing stall descriptions. While the content was being created, our app designers and developers got to work on the UI and UX; a task that saw us faced with one of our biggest challenges so far &#8211; following our own advice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MC1-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="468" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1148 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-1024x661.jpg" alt="london street food market" width="840" height="542" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SD-2-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1147 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/S1-1024x609.jpg" alt="mobile app developers london" width="840" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UX/UI</span></p>
<p>Time and time again we see clients trying to make their app too complicated, and it is our job to encourage them not to get carried away when it comes to the app&#8217;s features. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term MVP, or minimum viable product, and this was something we had to keep coming back to while brainstorming ideas and designing features and screens for Streats. I guess what we&#8217;re saying is, well, we finally know the struggle! The temptation to add in a few extra features was strong, but we&#8217;re proud to say we stuck to our guns. The finished UI and UX designs were simple, easy to navigate and allow the actual content to do the talking &#8211; Charlie&#8217;s beautiful photographs. The best part? We have <em>plenty </em>of room to expand, monetize and grow the app based on <em>real</em> user feedback and not just our potentially biased opinion of how Streats should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1149" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Browse-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing </span></p>
<p>We know the importance of social media when it comes to marketing a product (we write <a href="http://www.borneagency.com/blog">blogs</a> on this topic pretty much every week), and with a platform as visual as Streats, there was no doubt we would have to utilize <a href="http://www.instagram.com/getstreats">Instagram</a> to get people interested. However, we also wanted to do something a bit different to help us stand out from the foodies dominating social media. So, we decided we would have a crack at some old-school flyers, alongside making our very own promo video. After all, any publicity is good publicity right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Promo Video</span></p>
<p>We decided to do a promo video. Yes, I know this is starting to sound more and more like an episode of The Apprentice, but bare with us. Now, none of us are actors, but we like to think we&#8217;re a reasonably attractive bunch (or at least we were before all the street food took it&#8217;s toll), so we decided to create and star in our own commercial. Really, what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Well, aside from our dignity, not much. So, we brainstormed, we ate some food, we brainstormed some more and we came up with an idea for our very own promo video. We spent a sunny (ish) Thursday on the roof of our office building; filming, moaning about how hungry we were, and promising leftover street food to anyone who told us we weren&#8217;t allowed to be up there.</p>
<p>As is the nature of the film industry, a two hour task took eight and by the time we had finished recording we couldn&#8217;t have eaten the leftover food without risking a serious bout of salmonella.</p>
<p>The finished product will be up on our social media sometime this week, so make sure you follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/borneagency">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/borneagency">Instagram</a> to get first look!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-20-at-16.23.54.png" alt="mobile app developers " width="719" height="561" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flyers</span></p>
<p>Anyone who hands our flyers on a regular basis will know this &#8211; unless you&#8217;re handing out free food, people will avoid you like the plague. Whilst we love to think that Streats sells itself and that passers by will actually be queuing up to get our fliers, this just isn&#8217;t true. London is a notoriously grumpy city and the reality is, we&#8217;re going to have to reel people in with free food and pray that no one chucks our flyer into the next bin they see.</p>
<p>When it came to designing the flyers, we decided interactive was the way forward. Yes, you can spout some crap about your app and how great it is (a bit like we&#8217;re doing in this blog post), but people don&#8217;t want to read that. They want free food, and they want something that might distract them from the misery of their Monday morning. So, we came up with a quiz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re yet to face the mean streets of London with our flyers (this is due less to the fact that the streets are &#8216;mean&#8217; and more because we simply haven&#8217;t had time), but we will let you know we get on. If you&#8217;re lucky you might catch us around Old Street underground handing out a little treat to passers-by. Do us a favour and don&#8217;t throw the flyer in the bin. Thanks.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1143" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerFront-1024x723.png" alt="mobile app developers" width="840" height="593" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1142" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flyerBack-1024x723.png" alt="street food london" width="840" height="593" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Finished Product</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been scrolling through Instagram, downloading a workout or manically swiping right on Tinder (hey, we&#8217;ve all been there) and stopped to wander how these apps actually came to exist then read on.</p>
<p>This post will explain the ins, the outs and the methods used in mobile app development. We could spew out some complicated tech jargon to make us sound intelligent but luckily, we&#8217;re not like that. The point of this blog is to emphasize that anyone really can create a winning app &#8211; all you need is imagination, dedication and a couple of app developers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Every app development company will vary in their services offered, but they will all follow roughly the same formula when it comes to developing the product. This blog will explain our processes, how we work with our clients and the methods we use to turn a single idea into an app so addictive it gives people thumb cramp.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Work</span></p>
<p>We use the Waterfall Model in all our projects &#8211; which sounds a lot more glam than it really is. Essentially, this allows our clients to stay involved, as we are regularly providing them with a set of deliverables. They can keep up to date with the progress of their project and make sure that we are working to their standard, timeline and specifications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Do We Even Begin?</span></p>
<p>So many people have an idea for a great app, yet are never given an outlet to produce it. They aren&#8217;t confident in their idea, don&#8217;t understand tech talk or, in many cases, simply have no idea where to begin.</p>
<p>In our initial kick-off meeting we attempt to extract these great ideas (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t involve surgery). We want to get the ball rolling, the creative juices flowing and the ideas bouncing back and forth. We&#8217;re aware this sounds very hap-hazard and hipster, but trust us, it works. We even provide sweets just in case we&#8217;re not quite buzzing enough on tech talk.</p>
<p>When we have settled on something more concrete, our Project Manager will begin structuring the project, making sure the app is both feasible and possible. A first app should be the minimum viable product or MVP (we will write more on this in a future post), so the PM&#8217;s job at this stage is to stop the client getting too carried away adding more and more features. We&#8217;ve seen the &#8216;kid in the ice cream shop&#8217; scenario happen too many times, and trust us, it never ends well. The temptation to add something else is always there, so we need to make sure that what we develop really is the MVP, something which can be expanded on once we have some real user feedback.</p>
<p>From here, the PM will put together the functional spec. This contains a full list of the app&#8217;s features. It needs to be thoroughly examined by both client and developers, to make sure the requirements and timeline match up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design</span></p>
<p>Once the functional spec has been signed off on both sides, we&#8217;re ready to start creating the product. Our two Lead Designers, Elliott and Cris, are creative and passionate &#8211; skills which more than make up for their average to poor levels of office banter.</p>
<p>The design is done in two parts. We begin with the UX (user experience), which is the most logical representation of the functional spec. Don&#8217;t panic, this will not look like the real thing. Or, if it does, we can only apologise. Full UX design with a list of the functionalities is for the Developers mainly &#8211; they&#8217;re an extremely intelligent bunch and see things in a different way to the Average Joe. We will deliver the UX design in a user-friendly format to the client. Once that has been signed off we can get cracking with the next phase of design.</p>
<p>UI (user interface) design is where the fun really starts. This is where all the client&#8217;s branding, artistic and colour scheme dreams come true (there is no judgement here for dreaming of colour schemes). We want to achieve the right look and feel of the product, so our Designers work closely with the client to make sure it looks as close to how they envisioned as possible. Now and again the client pops in to see us, which we like to think is because we are great people to be around, but it&#8217;s just because we have really nice coffee.</p>
<p>Once the UI design is delivered and signed off, there are high fives all round and we might even make the Designers a cup of tea. After that: development begins (cue dramatic music).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation &amp; Verification </span></p>
<p>It is a common misconception that testing is done at the end of the project, however we&#8217;re firm believers that we should identify and fix unexpected results at each stage of a project, rather than allowing problems to escalate &#8211; resulting in nervous breakdowns all round.</p>
<p>The development and testing phase of the project is where everything starts to get a bit techie and, depending on the size of your app, this can take anything from 4 days to 1 year.</p>
<p>The first step in the development process is for our Front End Developers to translate the visual design laid out by our designers into a clickable prototype. A clickable prototype does what it says on the tin, you can move between screens and experiment with transitions &#8211; however none of the functionality has yet been applied.</p>
<p>Following this we work to implement some of the more basic API endpoints such as registration and profile creation before releasing an alpha build to the client. An alpha build will still be very &#8220;raw&#8221; but will have passed stringent QA acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Only when the app passes our QA team&#8217;s extremely high standards and the core functionality is in a usable state will we release the first build we consider a &#8220;beta&#8221;. The beta stage is the first chance to start testing the full flow of a mobile application, from registration through to completing all user journeys. Stress testing continuously to mimic real world usage; at this stage we will be looking for bugs, unexpected behaviour and crashes.</p>
<p>There is usually a large amount of work to do between the first beta build and an app that is fit for the app store, often an app will go through multiple beta releases that progressively get closer to your launch specification. Only once all the bugs have been ironed out will the build be considered &#8220;launch ready”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance<br />
</span></p>
<p>Just because the app has launched doesn&#8217;t mean the work is done. If the client signs a maintenance package with us, our PM will develop a plan with weekly sprints to develop and support all features of the product. If something goes wrong, we are onto it. From here, the client can start collecting some analytics and stats, helping them to plan for the second version of their product.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Version 2</span></p>
<p>They say you only start really learning to drive once you&#8217;ve passed your driving test and the same could be said for apps. Once we get some real user feedback we can work out what we can do to make it better, and that is when we start work on version 2. This also is the time for the client to start adding in some new features, think about monetizing their app if they haven&#8217;t already, and gain some insights into how users have been responding so far.</p>
<p>We hope this post has encouraged you and made you realise that mobile app development isn&#8217;t quite as complicated as it may first appear. Please <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact/">get in touch</a> if you want to know a bit more about the services we offer, or just fancy a chat about how your day is going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is a time for indulgence. Whether it&#8217;s Quality Streets, mince pies or that extra glass of Baileys, we all love to treat ourselves, and we continue to treat ourselves even when our jeans refuse to do up and the scales scream at us to stop eating. We carry on because we know that, come January, everything changes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re anything like the team at Borne Digital, you may have set yourself a New Year&#8217;s resolution to lose weight. However, despite all our good intentions, this resolution (alongside turning you into a New Year&#8217;s cliché) has a worryingly low success rate.</p>
<p>In a study of American people, the percentage of people in their 20s who actually manage to achieve their resolutions is just 37.8%. Now if that&#8217;s not an excuse to sack it in altogether and dive head first into a wheel of brie then I don&#8217;t know what is. It&#8217;s safe to say that when it comes to the all important January detox, the cards are definitely not stacked in our favour.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the explosion of fitness tech, we all seem convinced that this January will be different. We no longer need to hire personal trainers or nutritionists to help burn off five portions of roast potatoes, we have our fitness tech. From calorie counting apps, motivational podcasts to fitness wearables, we have everything we need to reach optimum health by the end of January, right?</p>
<p>As the proud owners of Fitbits, we are spending this January tracking our heart rate, our step count, our water intake and the protein content of our egg mayonnaise sandwiches. We are more clued up than ever thanks to our wearables, and we are not the only ones. It is estimated that the wearable tech market will be worth $34 billion dollars by 2020.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But, do they actually work?</span></p>
<p>We cannot deny the incredible insights fitness wearables give us into our day-to-day movements. Being able to see, at a glance, how your resting heart rate has changed over time or how many calories you have burned that day is strangely absorbing and the benefits huge. By monitoring, well, everything, fitness wearables can help users see how much we are actually eating, remind us to drink more water or encourage us to take the stairs instead of the lift. Encouraging these good habits seems a sure-fire way to trim our waistlines and increase our fitness.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not all sunshine and rainbows when it comes to our portable personal trainers. Studies on the accuracy of the wearables showed that Fitbit Flex, Jawbone UP24 and Misfit Shine <em>all</em> overestimated calorie expenditure during aerobic exercise and underestimated it during resistance training. Although each tracker seemed to be consistent in it&#8217;s margin for error, this is unlikely to reassure the flab-fighting users and is a big concern for anyone taking their fitness seriously.</p>
<p>Fitbit have come under fire for their heart rate inaccuracies, and have faced <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/06/fitbit-heart-rate-accuracy-lawsuit/">law suits</a> in the past. For healthy users, an inaccurate heart rate tracker is inconvenient and annoying, but for those with heart problems, inaccurate heart rate monitors are potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>However, even if we ignore the potential inaccuracies for the time being, is a fully functioning, completely accurate fitness wearable the solution to our steadily increasing waistline? Alas, it&#8217;s still a no. While the wearables of course work for many users, some have claimed that their fitness technology has actually caused them to <em>gain </em>weight. <a href="http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/1287314">Fitness tech forums</a> are filled with threads of people asking fellow users whether they too, have gained weight since they began using their fitness tech.</p>
<p>This rather concerning feedback has been reinforced by a study in which <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/20/494631423/weight-loss-on-your-wrist-fitness-trackers-may-not-help">470 people were put on a low-calorie diet</a> and asked to increase their exercise. All began to lose weight and, 6 months in, half the group were given fitness trackers to monitor their activity and calories. After two years, results showed that the people using the fitness trackers actually lost <em>less </em>weight than those without them.</p>
<p>So is it time to hurl our watches out the window and face the terrifying world of low-fat yoghurt and kale smoothies alone? Not quite.</p>
<p>It may sounds obvious, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that it is not the fitness tracker that creates the success stories and #TransformationTuesday photos we see on Instagram. It is hard work and dedication. There is only so far tracking every step and calorie consumed can get you. Sure, the knowledge is valuable, but knowledge itself will not make you lose weight. Putting your body through hell on the treadmill and weighing your spinach every morning however, may do. Fitness wearables are not magic wands, you still have to put in the effort.</p>
<p>Experts also seem concerned that wearables provide false assurances that people are staying active. After seeing you have completed 10,000 steps, it is easy to reason with yourself that you are done for the day, even if those 10,000 steps were spent wandering around Westfield shopping centre clutching a cheeseburger in one hand and a can of Fanta in the other. Let&#8217;s face it, doing this doesn&#8217;t really count, but when it comes to analysing the information your Fitbit gives you, it is easy to see how people convince themselves that it does.</p>
<p>We are refusing to feel demoralised and will continue to use our fitness wearables in our daily lives, albeit taking it&#8217;s analysis with a pinch of salt. As long as the tech encourages users to adopt healthy habits, we&#8217;re confident that we will continue to see the scales drop, or at least until national &#8216;throw in the towel day&#8217;, two weeks into the new year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world of Black Mirrors, I, Robots and Terminators, it’s no wonder people fear technology or more specifically, robots.. For all the progress we are making, the message portrayed on television, media and in books is loud and clear; artificial intelligence (AI) is going to end us.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking have all shared concerns on artificial intelligence, and, while they haven&#8217;t yet alluded to murderous robots, their concerns are not far off. Musk claimed in 2014 that AI is the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat">serious threat to the survival of the human race</a>. We actually thought the same until Trump was elected.</p>
<p>Musk himself has invested in AI research through his non-profit OpenA, claiming he wants to &#8216;keep an eye on what&#8217;s going on&#8217;, due to the potentially dangerous outcome. Well, I don&#8217;t know about you, but if there&#8217;s one person we trust to take care of us when the robots attack, it&#8217;s Musk.</p>
<p>Bill Gates has also voiced concerns. Although he said it will be &#8216;decades&#8217; before artificial intelligence poses a threat to humans, he admitted that he is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780">&#8216;in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence&#8217;</a>. Stephen Hawking took his concerns even further. He said he believes that the &#8216;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540">development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race</a>&#8216;. In an open letter to the AI community this year, Hawking wrote that &#8216;one can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand&#8217;.</p>
<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has a rather more optimistic approach. Zuckerberg believes that &#8216;along the way we will figure out how to make [AI] safe&#8217;, and compared our fears to how we would originally have felt about planes. If people were focused on safety first, said Zuckerberg, &#8216;no one would ever have built a plane. This fearful thinking might be standing in the way of real progress&#8217;.</p>
<p>As Zuckerberg has experienced the benefits of AI first hand, it&#8217;s no wonder he&#8217;s feeling so chirpy. He revealed earlier in the year that he is dedicating his year to making a home AI butler, telling The Verge that it can already control his home and make his breakfast. Future plans include teaching it to let his friends into his home by looking at their faces when they ring the doorbell, and chatbot capabilities. Just you wait until it turns evil, Mark.</p>
<p><strong><u>The real worry</u></strong></p>
<p>It seems reasonable to argue that currently, AI is not that dangerous. Yes, people remain sceptical of ‘super intelligence’, but at the moment it’s not too much of a threat to the human race. We can’t see Amazon’s Echo conspiring against us.</p>
<p>But, we still have a number of reasons to be concerned. What if it&#8217;s not a case of what AI will do to humans, but in fact the opposite? What could humans do to AI? Can we trust the humans behind artificial intelligence not to abuse their power? Essentially the biggest worry right now is, what happens when Trump gets involved?</p>
<p>The real concern here is the security of AI&#8217;s programming. There is no reason why robots won&#8217;t be hacked maliciously by criminals. In this instance it would not be the robots turning bad of their own accord, but humans turning them bad.</p>
<p>Although this fear itself seems a little far fetched (although less so than the idea of fully conscious murderous robots roaming our streets), hacking is a modern day concern that can effect us all. Just this year, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/12/before-you-sign-up-for-a-self-driving-car-pay-attention-to-hacker-charlie-miller/">remotely hacked a moving car</a>, bypassing the vehicle&#8217;s safeguards. Miller hoped that his work into the security of self-driving would help car manufacturers build better protections into cars, and their message hasn&#8217;t been ignored. Chrysler are offering a cash sum to hackers who inform the company of flaws in it&#8217;s vehicles. This is an example of AI being hacked, can we really trust that it won&#8217;t happen to our super-intelligent robotic butlers?</p>
<p>So, although media-represented AI doesn’t seem to be a current threat, it is still totally rational to be concerned about AI. Yes, AI could soon assist us, and in fact do a huge number of tasks for us. AI could work in deadly environments where humans are unable to, instantly translate a huge number of languages and diagnose diseases, yet we cannot ignore the potentially dangerous consequences. 100 years from now, will AI have saved or destroyed us? The jury’s out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems only yesterday that we were lying on our friend’s sofa vowing to abstain from all alcohol for the entirety of 2016 before being coerced into a pub trip by our pesky co-workers the first Friday back in the office.</p>
<p>Yes, the start of the year seems no time ago at all, but 2016 is nearly over. There are under 9 weeks left of the year and this, coupled with the arrival of the colder weather, has got us feeling all nostalgic. 2016 has been a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">huge</span> year for tech, with ideas, inventions and innovations popping up left right and centre&#8230;and 2017 is only going to be bigger.</p>
<p>Let’s recap some of the biggest tech innovations of 2016 and our predictions for the tech world in 2017.</p>
<p><u>Augmented reality</u></p>
<p>Well Pokémon Go launched in July and thanks to the enormous number of nostalgic noughties kids roaming the streets with little to do, it took off at an astonishing rate. Created by layering animations over the real world, augmented reality is not quite as spell-bounding as virtual reality, but it has certainly got off to a good start. Pokémon GO received more than 100 million downloads in its first month.</p>
<p>A wider used, although less recognized, augmented reality is Snapchat’s filters which also launched this year. It’s now virtually impossible to scroll through your Snapchat stories without seeing someone sporting dog ears or the filter that makes us all look 100% more attractive than we actually are.</p>
<p>2016 has been the year that augmented reality has really taken off and, whilst Facebook attempt to outdo the augmented reality world with their acquisition of virtual reality Oculus, it’s Snapchat who have won this round.</p>
<p>Looking towards 2017, we’re expecting to see augmented reality used in everyday life from gaming to shopping to education.</p>
<p><u>Virtual reality</u></p>
<p>Virtual reality (VR) has exploded in 2016 and in general, the response has been positive. It is now used widely in the military, healthcare and entertainment industries. 2016 has seen Sony, Facebook and HTC launch visors to transport us into another world, and the possibilities for future developments are endless.</p>
<p>But will anyone actually invest in these expensive headsets? Supposedly just 3% of British people are expected to buy a VR headset this year primarily due to the enormous price tag. There is also a sense of vulnerability that comes from sitting blind at your television, as well as, it appears, inside VR itself. Just last week a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted in virtual reality whilst she was blasting zombies alongside real-time players. The woman documented her experience in a <a href="https://medium.com/athena-talks/my-first-virtual-reality-sexual-assault-2330410b62ee#.eetli8w58">Medium post</a> which has sparked questions on how we differentiate between annoyance and assault inside virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Whilst virtual reality is starting to become more accessible and it’s clear the big tech giants are trying to make something of it, it’s yet to be seen as a ‘must-have’ piece of tech. We’re looking forward to see how this changes in 2017.</p>
<p><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></p>
<p>Whilst mentions of artificial intelligence still bring with it fears of I, Robot, The Terminator and, well, the inevitable destruction of humanity as a whole, 2016 has been the year AI has begun to flourish. Whilst of course, it is highly likely that robots will eventually take over the world (not really), we may as well enjoy testing the limits of technology whilst we can.</p>
<p>The view that AI systems will signify the end of humanity is no joke and the fear is surprisingly wide-spread. However, at September&#8217;s O’Reilly AI conference, CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, Oren Etzioni said that ‘working to prevent AI from turning evil is like disrupting the space program to prevent over-population on Mars’. Essentially, Etzioni means, stop being so ridiculous.</p>
<p>Etzioni concluded with the reassurance ‘AI is not going to exterminate us, AI is going to empower us’, going on to say that the real concern is its impact on jobs. Watch this space for future developments and the (possible) destruction of humankind.</p>
<p><u>Drones</u></p>
<p>2016 saw Drones not only become more consumer focused, but also start to be used in a different way. A huge number of drones have launched this year and in October, the first drone delivery service was launched in Rwanda. The US start up running the project is named Zipline, and the drones deliver blood, plasma and coagulants to hospitals across the country.</p>
<p>In 2017, things are only going to get bigger. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/20/sorry-terminator-conspiracists-ai-equipped-drones-can-now-think-for-themselves/">Venturebeat</a> thought up some of the possible expansions for drones in 2017, including monitoring of crops for first signs of diseases, traffic enforcement or locating and herding cattle. They also broke news which will &#8216;strike fear into the heart of any Terminator movie conspiracists&#8217;, that experts are starting to merge drones with AI systems, with incredible results. Where humans were previously needed to interpret the data drones collect, AI systems are now able to, reducing the need for human controllers. This somewhat disconcerting integration of AI and drones is paving the way for huge changes in 2017, and we can&#8217;t wait to see how it unfolds in various industries.</p>
<p><u>Virtual Assistants &amp; Chatbots</u></p>
<p>Although Siri, Cortana and Google Now have been around for a while, 2016 has seen a rise in virtual assistants and improvements in their capabilities. Our digital helpers are now far more competent at actually understanding what we say to them which is great because, let’s face it, trying to get anything useful out of previous Siris is frustrating at best.</p>
<p>Supposedly this is only the beginning. Soon we will be typing messages to apps and speaking to devises which will do all the hard work for us. Market research firm Gartner believes that soon all intelligent objects will have some form of conversational interface meaning more time for us humans to relax in the knowledge that our robotic servants will do the hard work for us.</p>
<p>And chatbots are being revamped too. Mark Zuckerberg announced in April that third parties could use the Facebook Messenger platform to launch their own chatbot, and since then, the popularity of bots has grown all over the world. Chatbots are being designed to work in such a way that they are able to answer most queries placed by customers. We think 2017 will bring more brands integrating chatbots into their apps.</p>
<p><u>Internet of Things &amp; self-driving vehicles</u></p>
<p>Everyday objects have become connected in 2016, with a number of items being recreated with built-in chips, sensors or apps. Like so many great developments, there was controversy surrounding the internet of things when a pet feeder malfunctioned back in July. We think the lesson to be learned is that if your pet’s life is at stake, it’s probably best to just do it yourself.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles have been all the rage in 2016, and in October the first driverless car took to the UK city of Milton Keynes. Uber passengers in Pittsburgh will soon be able to hail self-driving cars. The first self-driving Uber was spotted this October and, whilst there have been a few little niggles (if you call driving the wrong way down a one-way street a ‘little niggle’), things are looking good.</p>
<p>2016 has been the year for making progress towards a solely driverless future. Predictions are that within five years we’ll all be chauffeured around by our cars, free to spend all our car-time responding to emails, texting or, in my case, getting carsick.</p>
<p>So what’s next for 2017? Well we’re looking forward to seeing how self-driving cars continue to expand, but there are still a number of people who are sceptical. A few issues being brought up are the classic ‘kill the children or kill yourself’ conundrum, privacy concerns as your entire journey history is recorded and what the cars will do when an emergency services vehicle is behind it. These issues will all need to be addressed before the public will fully trust self-driving vehicles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the launch of Google’s Allo, a “smart” messaging app, users are exploring the new and improved world of chatbots. Google Allo works like many other messenger apps, but there is no need to create an ID. In fact, all you need is a phone number.</p>
<p>Allo links to Google Assistant. Users can type in their question and Allo will search for the answer in a similar way to Apple’s Siri. Allo differs however, as messages are typed, not spoken.</p>
<p>Yes, Allo can save you time and provide users with information on request (and it will also intrude on your conversations with seemingly ‘helpful’ suggestions), but does it, and other bots such as Siri, really make all our techie dreams come true?</p>
<p>The answer is no, it does not. Because, in a number of situations, the UX falls flat.</p>
<p>Take, for example, ordering a pizza via a chatbot such as Google Allo. In the app, you might select the pizza you want, confirm or add your address, add any extras, confirm payment and receive confirmation that the pizza is on it’s way. If details are already saved into the app, very little effort and few taps are required.</p>
<p>Compare that to having to physically type to Google Allo for example. Currently it is not as easy as typing, ‘order me a pepperoni pizza’ and having it delivered to your door in 30 minutes. Even if it does eventually become this easy, many would struggle to trust it. How do we know the bot has the right address? How do we know the bot has our correct payment details? Will it give us the option of adding extras? We cannot be sure of these without typing subsequent questions, far more effort than simply having the options laid in front of us, in an easy to read, well-designed pizza delivery app.</p>
<p><u>Do people actually use bots?</u></p>
<p>Well how often do you use Siri? At this stage in the game, most people would rather check the weather app on their smartphone, than open up Siri and ask him themselves. Whilst this will likely change, the current status of bots is that they do not receive the same love and attention from users that mobile applications do.</p>
<p>The current status of bots is that they are not intuitive. We do not know what works, and we do not know how to get the best out of them. We cannot know, without long-term, potentially frustrating use. Siri is still growing, Apple are pouring huge amounts of resources into advancing the virtual assistant, yet 70% of iPhone users admit to using Siri only sometimes or rarely.</p>
<p>Why is this? Well, <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/98-of-iphone-users-have-tried-siri-but-most-dont-use-it-regularly-2016-6">Business Insider </a>argues it’s all to do with the context. People tend to only use voice assistants when they’re alone or in the car for example. Essentially, it seems people don’t like to be seen talking to their technology. There’s something unsettling about it. Something a bit nerdy, a bit &#8216;computer-geek&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whilst the undeniable skill and time invested into developing these bots is huge, the average smartphone user may struggle to appreciate this. At the end of the day, they just want to be able to order a pizza without looking like a fool in front of their friends. Until users are confident that bots will understand their every word, and everyone is using them freely, it’s unlikely we will see them used openly in public space in the same way apps are.</p>
<p><u>What about startups?</u></p>
<p>Even the simplest of bots is extremely complex and expensive to engineer. Their rather limited user testing means that developers and users alike do not yet know what works in the world of bots.</p>
<p>So, it seems apps provide a more stable platform for start-ups and brands to unleash their creative energies. Mobile apps provide far more opportunity to build a community of users, and currently offer a far better user experience than bots.</p>
<p>But we cannot deny that times are changing and the key here is adaptability. Entrepreneurs will need to work extra hard to ensure relevance and market fit. There is no longer space for low-quality, advert clogged apps. We no longer want a quick boredom fix to eat up our phone storage and bombard us with popups or compulsory in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Whilst arguably, apps are, at this stage a better platform for start-ups and enterprises, we, mobile app developers included, need to become aware that as technology advances, the apps we design and develop will also need to. The apps will still need excellent UI and UX, and will have to be something users feel they actually <em>need</em>. Snapchat and Uber are still booming &#8211; as Snapchat fills a hole in our selfie-deprived lives.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, future apps will need to be able to work in conjunction with bots. Together, mobile app developers and their clients need to ensure the apps they do produce are of the highest quality, and can be adapted to work alongside the growing technologies.</p>
