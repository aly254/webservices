				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Unit Tests and Mocking with Android</strong></h2>
<p>Automation testing has a large role in developing software. Through the years this field has evolved and become incredibly broad – it’s difficult to navigate such massive amount of information or even pick a starting point.</p>
<p>This is especially true for mobile app automation where one can find multitude of different tools and approaches. The answer to “Which one should I use?” more often than not is “It depends” based on the specific circumstances. All of them enable our favourite services, apps and experiences to function smoothly and to improve constantly.</p>
<p>With this series, the intent is to provide a short view on the popular tools used for automation and how they ultimately fit together.With the first article, let’s take a look at one of the extremes – unit testing for Android mobile apps and the tools coming with the platform. The same holds true for iOS with XCTest framework.</p>
<h2><strong>Native tools for Android</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>&#8211; Android&#8217;s Junit tests, Mockito and Espresso</strong></h3>
<p>For the past 10 years, Android has matured into providing a rather comprehensive suite of tools and software development approaches to provide sustainable testing capabilities.Unit tests are focused on providing information on the smallest pieces that can be verified within the app. Espresso is a tool to handle UI tests and used for broader, more comprehensive tests on the overall segments of the application.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8211; JUnit tests</strong></h3>
<p>JUnit tests are at the core – simple Java tests, which are perfect for verifying the behaviour of small pieces of code and extremely quick to execute.</p>
<p>This is one of examples found in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests#kotlin"><strong>Android documentation</strong></a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2804 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.43.06.png?_t=1594915394" alt="" width="763" height="391" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.43.06.png 763w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.43.06-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>At a first glance, this example doesn’t appear to provide much value. We grab a small function <code>readStringFromContext_LocalizedString()</code> and compare its output with a known value that is correct. It’s easy to verify this without the test as well, so why write it?</p>
<p>The answer is rather easy – creating the test and running it takes minimal effort. Checking such a small piece of functionality manually on the other hand, takes significantly more time and effort in comparison.</p>
<div>Let’s expand and provide something more visually scary representative as of how the small unit tests provide value. This example comes from an older version of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801">Udacity’s Popular Movies</a> project and its purpose is to verify that data is correctly inserted into a SQL table:</div>

<p>It’s almost completely different than the initial simplistic example at a glance. On closer inspection, it uses the same internal methodology – take a function from the app, feed it information and verify if the result matches an expected value. The time required to verify manually if the above functions work correctly, immediately becomes far less appealing, doesn’t it? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Create enough of those small, cheap tests and the application’s base transforms into robust piece. Any change to the project from updates to the Android version, libraries, further extension of the code and so on, will have a quick method of notifying you as the developer that the behaviour has changed at a precise position.</p>
<p>Don’t let the simplistic examples from the documentations fool you – unit tests are amazing to let you and your team to spend time your time productively. They are faster and more accurate at repetitively verifying that the building blocks of the project are working correctly.</p>
<h2><strong>Mockito</strong></h2>
<p>Unit tests are great for simple logical checks but it’s rare when every piece inside the application can be tested on its own. An incredible amount of work is being done by developers to separate the responsibility of the code within a project for this exact purpose – just look at the plethora of MV* (insert series of letters here) patterns.</p>
<p>More often than not, the application relies on information provided from a server or the different pieces of code rely on each other to function as expected.</p>
<p>Welcome your new best friend, <a href="https://site.mockito.org/">Mockito</a> ! Android has <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests#mocking-dependencies">first class support</a> for this wonderful tool. This framework helps by “mocking” code which otherwise would be required for the unit tests. As an example, you may want to verify if the function to sort a list is correct. However, instead of creating an actual list of items or passing through several different layers of the app to get the list within the test to begin with (as the test won’t run without it), the list is mocked instead.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://site.mockito.org/">Mockito’s introduction example</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2814 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.56.28.png?_t=1594915394" alt="" width="865" height="272" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.56.28.png 865w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.56.28-300x94.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-16-at-16.56.28-768x241.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Notice that there is no explicit information provided about the `List.class`. The test doesn’t know how to create it or what is required for it. All of this is handled by Mockito leaving onlythe important piece – the code we want to test, to remain front and centre.</p>
<p>Mocking and dependency injection are indispensable tools to create extensive unit tests that provide value. They allow the opportunity to focus only on the piece of code that is of interest and remove the complexity from otherwise orchestrating a massive number of required steps to create the necessary environment to even run the test itself.</p>
<h2><strong>To be continued&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>This concludes the first part of the series. It displayed briefly what the smallest possible tests providing value are – the aptly named unit tests. They are an amazing tool for any software project!Next time, the focus will shift towards the larger UI tests and how they differ from their smaller counterparts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By far the biggest update in xCode history, this update brings different approaches to almost all fields of development on the platform. The closest addition to it in its’ lifecycle that we could compare to, would probably be bringing Swift to ObjectiveC in 2014.</p>
<p>While both updates where major, the key difference are the approach to building UI. With addition of the Swift, UIKit basically stayed intact. On the other hand, the SwiftUI’s most obvious change is the replacement of the UIKit. Storyboard and xibs were probably the biggest advantages for the longest period of time from Apple. We also noticed other platforms adopting similar approaches over the past few years, but Apple decide to drop them.</p>
<p><strong>SWIFTUI </strong>makes a hard break from that past because it’s a Swift-only framework. Not because Apple has decided that it’s time for Objective-C to die, but because it lets SwiftUI leverage the full range of Swift’s functionality (value types, opaque return types, protocol extensions, and more).</p>
<p>UI works using declarative syntax so that you can simply state what your user interface should do. As an example, we can write that you want in a list form consisting of images and text fields. You can follow this by describing other attributes like shape, aspect, etc. for image and alignment, font and colour for each field.</p>
<p>Drag and drop is still possible and can arrange components within your UI by simply dragging controls on the canvas. Use inspector to select font, color, alignment, etc. and easily re-arrange controls with your cursor. Most of these visual editors are also available within the code editors. It can be used to discover new modifiers for each control, even if you prefer hand-coding parts of your interface. You can also drag controls from your library and drop them on the design canvas or on the code directly.</p>
<p>The Swift compiler and runtime are fully embedded throughout Xcode, so your app is constantly being built and run. The design canvases are not just an approximation of your user interface it is a live app. We can look at Xcode too since it can swap edited code directly in your live app with “dynamic replacement”.</p>
<p>You can preview a SwiftUI side-by-side with its code. a change to one side will update the other side, so they’re always in sync. There aren’t any identifier strings to get wrong. And it’s code, but a lot less than you’d write for UIKit, so it’s easier to understand, edit and debug.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2735 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture2.png?_t=1593006264" alt="" width="1012" height="600" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture2.png 1012w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture2-300x178.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture2-768x455.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>View class is clutter with hundreds of methods and modifiers that gives flexibility on building the framework. However, this is a downside for discoverability. Even with compatibility with the UIKit, that means you can use SwiftUI inside UIKit ViewControllers or the other way around ie. UIViews inside SwiftUI Components. This should allow for easier transitions for developers to SwiftUI as well as projects that are already in progress on the UIKit.</p>
<p><strong>INTERFACE BUILDER </strong>revolves around reducing the amount of coding developers do which allows for you to design a full user interface without writing any code. Simply put,</p>
<p>“It is easier to independently design your interfaces separately from their implementations.”</p>
<p>‘Drag and drop’ is the biggest advantage to building a user interface programmatically. You can arrange components within your UI by simply dragging controls onto the canvas. Use inspector to set selected number of attributes like font, colour, alignment, etc, and easily re-arrange controls with your cursor.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>“Wait…what?</p>
<p>Just selected number of attributes? Why not all possible attributes?</p>
<p>Don’t worry about it, we’re gonna get back to it soon.”</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Storyboard and xib can be seen as visual representations of the application and a way of previewing your current UI progress. They are XML interface builder files. The XML generated is not documented correctly since it is hard to read, no tools to validate it, and it is almost impossible to write by hand. But the clue is in the same, ‘Interface builder’. It is not intended to be hard-coded or re-written or to require from you deeper dive into XML itself. It’s there so you can do UI simply, mostly using just your mouse.</p>
<p>There are things that are not available in inspector. You cannot hard-code them.</p>
<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>Simply, customise them within the implementation files. “Independently design” does not sound that much independent does it? We can use all this to run away to SwiftUI without even looking again to UIKit, especially if you are beginner. But as always, there is another side to the story. There is a reason why inspector has just selected a number of attributes. If you are interested in xCode, SwiftUI or UIKit, there is a big chance that you are there because of your interest in the app development sector.</p>
<p>So let’s use simple analogy from app development. The more features and customisations an app has, does not mean it is a better product overall. Too many bells and whistles can make the user loose interst in the app even before the user actually experienced core functionality of the product.</p>
<p>First registration screen (email, name, password) – done.</p>
<p>Second (interests, birth day, profile image) &#8211; makes sense.</p>
<p>Third screen (gender, phone number, location) – you’ve lost them.</p>
<p>People’s wants from a product are simple &#8211; to make their lives easier. The same thing can be said for UI inspector. There are probably just the right amount of things that it needs.</p>
<p>And for the rest, as usual, there are more than a few simple solutions but we just need to dig a bit more. For example we can use simple view, drag and drop it into Storyboard, change background colour and outside of that by the looks of it, there is not much what we can do in inspector. But we want corner radius, borders, shadow.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2734 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture3.png?_t=1593006188" alt="" width="596" height="657" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture3.png 596w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Picture3-272x300.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 85vw, 596px" /></p>
<p>IBDesignable and IBInspectable are there to allow developers to create interface (or view) that renders in Interface Builder in real time with custom attributes. In general, to apply this new feature, all you need to do is create a visual class by subclassing UIView or UIControl. You can just simply use this to write visual class for view from the previous example and declare all of the features we need. This will be available in inspector to adjust values. You can customise the amount of attributes available in inspector based on the product requirements or even enforce default values so that in most cases, it will preset required values for that additional attributes.</p>

<p>For any problem or “downside” on any of both approaches, if it is SwiftUI or UIKit, there more than a few solutions. Some of them can also be used as an advantage if used the right way in the end. Sure, if you are a beginner, SwiftUI sounds like the obvious choice as new kid on the block. But don’t forget that UIKit is here for the long haul and whatever you need, there are probably a variety of ready-made solutions that are just waiting on you to find them.</p>
<p>In the end it all comes down to personal preference and it may be for the best to simplify things when making the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Visual vs code, experience vs new journey, </strong><strong>independent vs dependent</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First things first, what are your goals for your MVP? For us, it should be to prove there is product market fit while taking on the least amount of risk possible. Founders are often excited about their ideas and are eager to start building features without proper planning. This could result in assumptions about their product being glossed over about their customers and their product as a whole.</p>
<p>During the earliest stages of your company, it is especially important to have open communication with current and potential customers to gain insight as to how they may use your product. Here at Borne, we achieve our product outcomes through design sprints which lets us decide quickly and efficiently understand the problems that may come up and get real-time feedback from our clients and their customers.</p>
<h2><strong>We implement these three things during the design sprint and the initial build of a product and design:</strong></h2>
<p>&#8211; Providing the product market fit so the product can be monetised</p>
<p>&#8211; Validating whether there are high risk factors to your product such as sensitive data.</p>
<p>&#8211; Getting actionable user-feedback through a MVP in the hands of your users to learn and facilitate what the next steps should be.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2543 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1.png?_t=1582625230" alt="" width="855" height="567" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1.png 855w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-300x199.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture1-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>As a founder, you will need to get to the core reason why someone would use your product after its release. You should be asking yourself these questions:</p>
<p><strong>“What Problem Does Your Product Solve?”</strong></p>
<p>Answering this question will let you understand your customers. It can be surprisingly easy to come up with solutions to problems that you may think exists. It shouldn’t be about what your product does, but what problem does it solve for your customers.</p>
<p><strong>“How Big of a Problem is This?”</strong></p>
<p>Is this a problem that people are experiencing on a daily basis or is it a minor inconvenience? Because, if your customer is having an issue it does not mean that they will go through the effort of using the product.</p>
<p><strong>“What is Your Value Statement?”</strong></p>
<p>Your unique value proposition should explain how your product is uniquely equipped to solve this problem and how this separates you from your competitors. By getting clear about why people would choose your product to solve a problem, this will help you sell the idea to customers, but also help our developers narrow in on what features should be prioritised for your MVP.</p>
<p><strong>“What Are Your Must-Haves and Nice-To-Haves?”</strong></p>
<p>As you are going through this process and asking yourself these questions, you are more than likely to come up with a large number of ideas of what your app <em>could do</em>. It is in that time that you should hone in on what your MVP needs to do. Ask the questions, does this feature need to be included to validate your product and does it align with your value statement. It is important to remember that the goal should be to build the absolute minimum needed to validate the product idea with minimal risk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Constantly Changing Markets</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2461 size-large" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581-1024x678.jpg?_t=1571327936" alt="" width="840" height="556" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581-300x199.jpg 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581-768x508.jpg 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581-1200x794.jpg 1200w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/backpack-business-co-working-2566581.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>The period over which a market research data is relevant may be limited because market parameters keep changing. Data collected for launching a new product may be outdated by the time the product is ready for a market launch. To ensure that your research stays relevant, you need to constantly monitor changing market conditions and update your data accordingly. An MVP approach allows you to remain in control of your product throughout and make changes according to the natural ebbs and flows of user feedback and market trends.</p>
<p>The MVP is that it does not reflect the prototype of your product nor the final product that will be released. The creation of an MVP is the fastest method in which to ensure that precious time and resources are not wasted in developing the product. One of the biggest mistakes that are made by start-ups and larger businesses are not taking the leap and spending months, if not years, developing a product that they base predominantly on user-feedback and target audience research. By larger businesses following suit and facilitating an MVP model wherein they could save valuable resources and time, they can find themselves having a faster churn of products that can be developed by nurturing ideas and making the necessary changes to the product after reliable feedback from launch feedback.</p>
<p>Once the product has been launched, feedback received will be expected. This can be both a negative and a positive. From experience, these same users will dislike the product and the start-up will understand that the resources that have been invested into the production of the final product would have been a waste. What an MVP allows you to do, it allows for product feedback over a shorter period thus significantly reduces costs. Development of an MVP could take anywhere between a month to a month and a half at a smaller budget. Overall, the MVP approach to product development will reduce risk of long-term failure and discovering at an earlier stage what is needed to make your product work and thrive.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2460 size-full" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph.png?_t=1571327590" alt="" width="625" height="460" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph.png 625w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>
To sum up the argument by choosing to go with an MVP, you can:</h2>
<p>• Find out in the earlier stages if your product is worth investing resources in<br />
• Research and validate your target audience and find out if they are fully invested and interested in what you are trying to achieve<br />
• Discover and create your customer base beforehand<br />
• Save your resources and time to collaborate in the production of the final version of your product as you will not need to invest large amounts in market research.<br />
• Lastly, you can invest time in seeking out investors in creating interest for your product before product launch.</p>
<h1>What You Need To Know Before Your MVP Is Created</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the MVP does not need to be ‘beautified’ or contain the burdens of various functions that would only be present in the final production of your product, you can observe the product and its fundamentals. This is what you would want to present and test in your user-research.</p>
<p>By developing a thorough MVP, it is important to strike the right balance between minimum design and maximum value. Creating an MVP that benefits both the client and the potential user allows us to focus solely on the simplest design because it may be difficult to have a direct line of communication between the user and ourselves to demonstrate the value of your product. We recommend that the first version of your MVP contains the bare essential functions and that the other functions are added over the course of QA and testing as you receive user feedback. This ensures that your product and its’ features correlate with the expectations and needs that your users are looking for in the product.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Agile Method, it is an incremental and iterative approach to the development of mobile application where the development cycle is sectioned into different sub-modules which are taken on as mini-projects. Every sub-module is given to a specific team at Borne and is subjected to complete the development cycle. This cycle is divided into designing and development, testing and finally, the delivery of the product to you for review. The advantages of the Agile Method in app development is the iterative nature of tech which allows for it to be of such high value in the tech market.</p>
<h1><strong>Here are our top reasons on why we chose the Agile Method for our development process:</strong></h1>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Rapid Development</strong></h2>
<p>The agile model allows for entire mobile app projects that we develop to be divided into smaller modules which can be treated like independent sub-projects. These sub-projects are handled by our individual teams which are handled independently. These have very-little to no reliance on one another. Aside from this, everyone is thoroughly briefed on the resources necessary to contribute to the production of your product which allows for the increase of the development process. By doing this, it gives you the safety in knowing that our developers have put in their absolute best work to complete their part of the project and produces a streamlined product in the quickest way possible.</p>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Quality Control</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike traditional forms of app development, the agile method does not test the app at the end-phase of development. This fosters the testing at the end of each phase of the module at a primitive level. By doing this, we are lessening the risk of encountering issues while testing the entire project. This also lets our developers inspect your project and its elements at every phase and adjust as needed. This results in producing a higher quality product.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>It Lessens Our Client&#8217;s Risk</strong></h2>
<p>The marketplace trends and requirements creates an atmosphere of risk in more ways than one. When developing your product, you have taken these risks into account. However, by the time your product reaches its launch phase, these trends may have passed. By taking part in the agile method, these tools allow you to take calculated risks whilst improving your market scope of your project. In other words, this allows for us to develop your product and make specific changes to suit these changes without disturbing the code of earlier sprints. By doing this, you make your application more suitable to the fluctuating market.</p>

<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>We Can Provide Impeccable Project Management</strong></h2>
<p>The agile method facilitates allows us to manage your projects easily. We can keep a perfect record of each task that is performed on every project we are working on. Because of this, we can pick up productivity levels of every individual of our team and keep track of this to ensure your project meets the required deadlines and provide you with feedback accordingly.</p>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>It Lowers Your Development Cost</strong></h2>
<p>By planning every step of the development of your project, we can calculate the approximate cost of creating your application and set realistic expectations to your development budget. Doing this can avoid mishaps by avoiding leaving your project incomplete owing to funds and resources.</p>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>It Can Improve Your Customer Experience</strong></h2>
<p>The agile mobile app development has a strong emphasis on customer experience which is facilitated through close collaboration with our clients to understand their vision. The projects we work on are passed onto our clients through tech sprints which brings transparency to our process. This enables us to check if both parties are happy with the result, adjust accordingly before proceeding further. This significantly decreases launching your app which does not fulfil your vision which will enhance your customer experience overall.</p>

<p>Our approach allows our developers to customise the development process throughout the course of your project. When it comes to digital product development, there are no specific rules to follow. In other words, the agile process facilitates developers to customise your development timeline according to their choice and deliver a product that is a user-centric solution.</p>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>You Earn A High Return Over Your Investments</strong></h2>
<p>The agile methodology has created a platform to let organisations like yours enter the market with the most basic app (MVP) and update it with each iteration. This makes things easier for you as it allows you to test your idea, collect the date you require and build up brand presence. You can then deliver the best features that you have found through this research according to your market and customer requirements. This helps you as well as our team to make the right decisions for obtaining for fetching the best ROI in your market.</p>
<h2 class="ellip"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>It Increases Customer Satisfaction Levels For Our Clients</strong></h2>
<p>The agile development process has an outstanding visibility and flexibility to make edits to your product and making sure that you as a product owner are always included in it. This results in improved customer satisfaction and engagement.<br />
<strong>Project management through the agile method allows for the following things to take place:</strong><br />
• Keeping customers engaged and involved during the development of your project.<br />
• Put forward functionalities to your consumers in sprint reviews.<br />
• Deliver your project to the market faster.</p>
<p>With the appropriate commitments in place and hard work, the agile method in app development promises engaging digital products in a short time-frame. But like everything, this method requires its own demands and implications that which offers you the perfect amount of effect and teamwork. Looking to take your product concept and make it agile? Get in touch and we can make that happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, product design or UX design is a crucial component in the making of mobile apps and websites. As you already know, design matters. As such, UX design helps to turn a simple idea into a beautiful, stunning and useful digital product. Thanks to UX design, users are able to return and use brands and their digital products over and over again.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you are a <a href="http://borneagency.com">mobile app developer</a>, program manager, product manager, project manager, marketing manager or a general user, it is important to understand UX design. In this article, we will focus on what is UX design, how UX design influences digital apps and product design. Also, we will touch on how UX designers can achieve user acquisition and retention.</p>
<p><strong>What is UX design?</strong></p>
<p>This is a creative and elaborate process where professionals identify a market opportunity, define the problem and create a solution for the problem(s). Also referred to as product design, it is the creation of digital products that enhance user experience.</p>
<p>The process involves the design of digital products such as mobile apps, includes aspects of design usability, functionality, and branding among others.</p>
<p><strong>Ways UX designers influence digital apps and product design</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Create digital solutions that support and enhance human interactions</em></p>
<p>UX designers contribute in numerous fields with one goal in mind, to enhance the experience of users as they interact with digital products. By doing this, they help to enhance growth and development among the people.</p>
<p>How are they able to achieve this? Working as a team, they create flows of layouts and interactions for health care, e-commerce, and education among others. These apps are applied in the fields above to offer tips, solutions, knowledge and technical support among others.</p>
<p>All of them help to influence how the final digital product will appear and function.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>Product research is a critical step in UX design. It allows the team to get feedback on what users are looking for. It also enables the team to learn what competitors have released in the market. Finally, it allows the team of designers to learn what aspects need to be improved in order to beat the competitors, attract users and retain them as well.</p>
<p>How should UX designers conduct research? Through user interviews, through online surveys, through competitive research, and through contextual inquiry. To ensure research is successful, plan your questions, find an experienced interviewer, keep it short and include both open-ended and closed-ended questions.</p>
<p>The team of designers and analysts should carry out meaningful research before settling on a certain design. As you already know, time spent during research is never wasted. It goes a long way in improving current and future products too. This helps the team save money, time and a lot of resources. As such, selling your ideas to other clients is easier. Here at Borne, we work with several UX tools that allow us to track user behaviour and consumer interactions that allow us to best design for the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>User analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data gathered from research needs to be analyzed in order to make sense. Through user analysis, the team is able to draw insights. Basically, they are able to capture, organize and make inferences about the users&#8217; needs which helps UX designers to come with the best digital products for the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to user analysis, the team identifies key user groups. Using this infor</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2385" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="291" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee.jpg 598w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/touch-heatmaps-app-usability-appsee-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 85vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>mation, they are able to create personas. These personas are fictional characters that help UX designers to figure out how users might use a digital product. Thanks to the creation of personas, UX designers understand the user&#8217;s goals. This is useful in ideation.</p>
<p>Designers should base the personas on real data. They should avoid using real names of people they know. Apart from personas, designers should create an empathy map, a tool that helps the team understand what users’ want and need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consider the why, what and how of product use</strong></p>
<p>Before embarking on a project, UX designers always consider the why, what and how of product use. The “Why” is all about product adoption by the masses. How they relate to tasks they want to perform and the views associated with the use of the product.</p>
<p>The “What” is all about functionality &#8211; things users will do with the final digital product. Will they use the digital product to learn, to gain knowledge, to collaborate, to entertain or manage everyday tasks?</p>
<p>Finally, we have the “How.” This encompasses the design of functionality. By this we mean, the designer should focus on how accessible and aesthetic the digital product will be.</p>
<p>In product design, UX designers always begin with the “Why” before embarking on the “What” and the “How.” By following this process, the team is able to create aesthetically pleasing and functioning digital solutions that offer meaningful experiences. Basically, the designers should ensure that the app, software, and website offers a fluid experience.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve actual problems</strong></p>
<p>There are tons of problems that digital solutions can solve. For instance, we need apps, websites, and blogs to disseminate information and news to the masses. To organize our daily schedules, we need to do list apps, calendar apps and note taking apps. When it comes to shopping for products, we need e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Finally, we have entertainment. Without apps and websites that enable us to stream, music, games, and videos, life would be dull.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. We need apps that allow us to do even simple things like keep time. To enhance usability and accessibility, UX design helps in the creation of aesthetic and intuitive interfaces and navigation. To achieve this, designers and mobile app designers spend hours building these products.</p>
<p><strong>Convert simple operations into intuitive and aesthetic pleasing to the human eye</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A lot of people imagine that UX design is all about dragging and dropping elements such as buttons, menus, color, and other elements. Yes, part of UX design is creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces for digital solutions. The other major part is largely about planning, research, analysis, and collaboration.</p>
<p>A vast majority of designers have been trained in internationally recognized institutions while others are self-taught. Thanks to the knowledge gained over a number of years, UX designers are proficient in combining beauty and functionality. And that is how they add value to digital solutions such as software, mobile apps, blogs, and websites.</p>
<p><strong>User Engagement and Retention in UX Design -How to Achieve It</strong></p>
<p>Upcoming designers always imagine that to attract and retain users on a mobile app, website, software or blog, the interface should be pretty. Well, that is not always the case. Take a website like Reddit. Even today when popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Material design feature on hundreds of blogs and websites, people still visit Reddit. Why? Simple layouts are still attractive.</p>
<p>So, what is the secret to user engagement in UX design? It is the experience itself. Users want to interact with an app or web platform on a simpler level. Yes, designers can incorporate colours, buttons, graphs, and menus but at the end of the day, what they want is to move from one page to the next with ease.</p>
<p>So, how can UX designers encourage user engagement? Here are a few techniques to achieve this</p>
<p><strong>Use of UX Animation</strong></p>
<p>Today, 2D animation plays a critical role in UX design. How? Diff<a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif"><img class="wp-image-2384 alignright" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ezgif-1-c7ac9debdff9.gif" alt="" width="369" height="277" /></a>erent animations can be created to elicit a particular behaviour. For instance, when a user hovers over a button, it can change colour say from red to green to show its clickable. Another example is error messages. They can pop up on a screen and shake. This helps to draw the attention of the user. So, to ensure user engagement, UX designers should create realistic animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simply the interface design</strong></p>
<p>As a UX designer, what you need to know is that users hate jumping through hoops when interacting with your mobile app, blog, software or website. People are interested in the final result. To achieve this, they need to use the quickest and simplest method. That means when designing, you should build UX flowcharts for every page especially when sketching wireframes. Imagine this, your website or mobile app requires users to sign up. If locating the sign-up page is difficult, they will opt to use other apps that offer a better experience. To simplify your digital products, start researching UX designs.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>
<p>The success of any digital product today and in the future will depend on better UX design. If you would like to find our more about how we employ design thinking and usability research into shaping our design decisions then <a href="http://borneagency.com/contact">get in touch. </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only one thing we love more than inspirational Steve Jobs quotes on Instagram, and that&#8217;s startups succeeding. From clients seeing their apps climbing up the App Store rankings, to the tech startups continually proving that there&#8217;s more to London than Big Ben and bad weather, success stories aren&#8217;t hard to to come by &#8211; especially in the capital.</p>
<p>Last year we wrote a post all about the <a href="https://borneagency.com/blogs/the-startups-doing-great-things-in-2017/">startups doing great things in 2017</a>, and it&#8217;s time for another dive into the tech world to see who&#8217;s flying high this summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2069" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img-1-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Stasher</h2>
<p>Lugging heavy bags around London is our worst nightmare, especially in this heat. Paying to store luggage at train stations is well up there on our &#8216;things we don&#8217;t want to pay for&#8217; list, alongside car park tickets, extra storage on Dropbox and tomato ketchup sachets at McDonalds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stress of dragging a heavy bag around means options are somewhat limited, and Stasher lessens the pain of paying for storage by making storing your luggage easy, affordable and safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://stasher.com/">Stasher</a> is based on the AirBnB model. They work with hundreds of shops and hotels in cities all across Europe to provide somewhere for travellers to store their luggage. Customers book through the website, receive a confirmation email and can drop their luggage off. All storage points have a secure area for storing bags, and every piece of luggage is insured for up to £750.</p>
<p>Storing your luggage with Stasher costs £6 for 24 hours, and £5 for every additional day. This is less than half the price of storing your bag for a day at King&#8217;s Cross station. All &#8216;StashPoints&#8217; are a few minutes walk from the station, and all you need to bring is proof of your booking.</p>
<p>To say that Stasher are smashing it would be an understatement. The company has raised over $1 million and have StashPoints across London, Paris, Rome, Florence and many more cities in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2070" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marshmallow-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Marshmallow</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marshmallow.com/">Marshmallow</a> want to lessen the financial difficulty that comes from moving to a new country.</p>
<p>Attempting to drive in the UK without a British driving license can feel like a never-ending series of hoops to jump through. Previous records mean absolutely nothing when it comes to car insurance, and Marshmallow are changing that.</p>
<p>Marshmallow is an insurance company that wants to make it easier for people to drive in the UK by accepting international licenses, as well as &#8216;no claims&#8217; bonuses from abroad. They have also ditched the fees, meaning those without a UK driving license will pay lower premiums, and can avoid being overcharged when they move to the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2068" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tandem-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Tandem</h2>
<p>We love anything fintech, and <a href="https://tandem.co.uk/">Tandem</a> is our latest venture into a new form of banking. While we’ll never neglect our trusty Monzo cards, the Tandem card is a great addition to our wallets and provides something slightly different in the way of features.</p>
<p>Not only does Tandem allow you to manage <em>all </em>your bank accounts using just one single app, it also helps to reduce your bills by finding you better deals. Tandem also automatically shows you how much you spend each month and notifies you when your bills are due.</p>
<p>So far, it’s the easiest way that we have found to manage our money completely &#8211; and it also has no fees when you spend or withdraw cash abroad.</p>
<p><a href="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2071" src="http://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png" alt="" width="1110" height="418" srcset="https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit.png 1110w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-300x113.png 300w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-768x289.png 768w, https://borneagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pockit-1024x386.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<h2>Pockit</h2>
<p>Another fintech startup (you may start to notice a theme developing here), <a href="https://www.pockit.com/">Pockit</a> wants to make bank accounts available to everyone, regardless of their income or credit status.</p>
<p>The company provides customers with an online account, a mobile app and Master Card. It’s open to all &#8211; meaning no credit checks, and users can sign up within minutes, receiving their card, account number and sort code. Money can be transferred to both UK and international bank accounts.</p>
<p>Pockit are also totally transparent about their fees, which is a welcome change in the banking world! The contactless Master Card costs 99p, as do bank transfers, ATM withdrawals and the monthly membership fee. The Pockit app is available on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pockit-online-current-account/id1022334791?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pockit.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_GB">Android</a>, is easy to navigate and well designed.</p>
<h2>Zego</h2>
<p>Last on the list we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.zego.com/">Zego</a>, who provide flexible insurance for self-employed workers. Zego provides insurance by the hour, which connects to work providers and only covers you when you are actually working.</p>
<p>With more and more people opting to work freelance for the flexible lifestyle it offers, insurance that mirrors this flexibility is well-needed. Zego&#8217;s first product was a pay-as-you-go scooter and car insurance for food delivery workers. Zego charges by the hour and drivers need only buy cover for when they are actually working.</p>
<p>For anyone self-employed thinking this sounds like a little too much to organise, Zego connects to the workplaces automatically. This means drivers don&#8217;t need to tell Zego when they are working. Instead, the cover starts once they log in for their shift.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immediately crushing any hopes and dream of a new iPhone, Tim Cook was quick to point out that Apple&#8217;s WWDC would be &#8216;all about software&#8217;. While we weren&#8217;t blown away by the software announcements last night, with many of them appearing to be a logical step up as opposed to something truly groundbreaking, the WWDC was still a good watch &#8211; we&#8217;ve got a lot to look forward to!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of yesterday&#8217;s WWDC.</p>
<h3>iOS 12</h3>
<p>First up is iOS 12 which, although lacking the &#8216;wow&#8217; factor of the iOS 10 or 11 announcements, is still a welcome update. The focus for iOS 12 is on speed and performance, and this new iOS will be supported by iPhones and iPads from as far back as 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Wellbeing</span></p>
<p>New features include a focus on digital wellbeing in the form of App Limits, which allows users to allocate times to use each app. App Limits will send users a warning when their time is running out, great for us Instagram addicts and Snapchatting teenagers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Memoji</span></p>
<p>On the subject of spending less time doing totally futile and irrelevant things on our iPhones, let us introduce Memoji, which we hate, but also kind of love.</p>
<p>Memoji allows you to turn yourself into an Emoji, putting a digital mask over your face in iMessage. You can add extra features like sunglasses and hats, and the face tracking technology will follow your movements so that your Memoji smiles, nods and speaks when you do. We don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ever going to use it, and we definitely think integrating it into FaceTime was a step too far &#8211; but it&#8217;s charming in a &#8216;brings back memories of The Sims&#8217; kind of way.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siri Shortcuts</span></p>
<p>Other improvements include a shortcut option for Siri in which simply saying a key phrase will take you to a certain app or feature. For example, &#8216;I&#8217;m heading home now&#8217; could open up your radio app and check the traffic, while &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a stressful day&#8217; might start a meditation. These shortcuts are also integrated into Apple Watch which we love.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group FaceTime</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve all been waiting for, group FaceTime.</p>
<p>Apple announced that we will soon be able to chat to up to 32 people at one time. While the UI is fairly impressive, we were all a little distracted as we frantically tried to work out how many friends we actually have (spoiler: not 32).</p>
<p>Once we recovered from our existential crisis, we were able to check out the UI which is looking good. Each member of the FaceTime chat has their own tile, which automatically expands while they are speaking.</p>
<p>We can certainly envision the app crashing with the tiles frantically enlarging and shrinking like an out of control firework display as more people try to make their voices heard, but let&#8217;s cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>
<h3>iOS Apps in Mac OS</h3>
<p>Apple has made the move to bridge the gap between Macs and iOS devices, and soon it will be easier to port iOS applications over to macOS. This is big news for app developers, who will receive the functionality sometime in 2019. The hope is that the desktop will become populated with native apps that look like their iOS counterparts. The first iOS apps available will include Stocks, News, Home and Voice Memos &#8211; so just the important ones then.</p>
<h3>WatchOS 5</h3>
<p>WatchOS 5 is getting the iOS 12 updates, which will make it more user friendly and intuitive when you want to talk to Siri. Instead of saying &#8216;Hey Siri&#8217; as you raise your wrist, users now need only raise their wrists and ask a question. Siri will recognise this interaction and reply.</p>
<p>The Podcast app is also being integrated into WatchOS 5 and notifications will be grouped, making the whole experience less overwhelming and distracting.</p>
<p>The best update to WatchOS 5? The walkie talkie mode. While we still long for the days of walkie talkies made out of plastic cups and string, chatting via WatchOS 5 is an alternative we&#8217;re willing to roll with.</p>
<h3>ARKit 2</h3>
<p>The second ARKit has a whole host of improvements. The big news is that there will now be multi-user support for augmented reality. This means that users can see the same AR objects from their devices at different angles, with LEGO demonstrating their virtual toys on stage.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new app Measure appears just like any other measure-via-AR app, but it&#8217;s got a few little extra quirks. The app will be able to automatically identify and measure objects, as well as allowing users to view the objects in actual size.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile app development is not always smooth sailing.  There&#8217;s only so much you and your brand new Macbook Pro can do, and unless you are highly skilled in market research, mobile app design, code writing and QA, you may need a bit of help!</p>
<p>But trawling through google trying to find the perfect <a href="http://borneagency.com/">mobile app development company</a> can be time-consuming and, let&#8217;s face it, a tad boring. Perhaps there&#8217;s the temptation to throw in the towel and abandon your idea altogether. But if you&#8217;ve got something good, it&#8217;s worth sticking with. We&#8217;ve seen entrepreneurs go from zero to hero, and it looks fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Mobile App Agency or Freelancers?</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to freelancers, app development agencies bring a depth of multi-disciplinary experience to your project. The combination of specialism and size may ensure the company is in a better position to deliver a larger scale project, however if it&#8217;s something simple like a logo design, hiring a freelancer could be more cost effective.</p>
<p>Our team have put together a failsafe guide to hiring a mobile app development company. Regardless of the size of your project, these top tips will help you to hire the right team for you, ensuring your product gets the best possible start in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1: Ask Around</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of our own clients come to us via referrals. Start ups often overlook the size of their network, and there is no better way to find the right app development company for you than through word of mouth.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the world of tech by attending some start up events &#8211; for those of you who are London based <a href="http://www.tech.london/events">Tech.London</a> is a great place to start. Network with other entrepreneurs and discuss their experiences have been with different companies. Even if they don&#8217;t have experience with mobile app developers specifically, they are bound to have some useful insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2: Show Them You Mean Business</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do you have to make sure that the app developers are the right people to take on your project, you also have to be a good fit for them. At Borne, we only take on projects which we can see the client is passionate about, and only if they have a well thought out plan for the future. We encourage our clients to think of us as partners and work with us on a one-to-one basis. Let&#8217;s just say, if we met our clients at the pub on a Friday night, it wouldn&#8217;t be awkward.</p>
<p>So, we recommend spending some time preparing for your initial meeting with answers to any questions you think that you might be asked. Bring with you a list of apps you enjoy using with the reasons why in order to help the team get a sense of what you are like, as well as designs you love. We tend to know what apps we enjoy using, but working out <em>why </em>is a different matter. Is it the ease of use? The colour scheme? It&#8217;s worth putting some thought into these in order to make the kick off meeting as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p>Arrive at the meeting with a clear description of what your app is going to be, how it will benefit the user, and a list of features the app must have. Arriving prepared allows the design and development team to see that you have actually taken time to think through your idea.</p>
<p>If the developers can see you are serious, they are far more likely to take on your project. Take the time to go through everything with your potential development team, ensure no stone is left unturned and the development process will run a lot more smoothly.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 3: Look At Their Previous Work</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you should never sign an app development contract without seeing examples of the work they have already produced.  You wouldn&#8217;t invest money in a house you haven&#8217;t seen, and with app development, the stakes are far higher (or maybe it&#8217;s only us who think that).</p>
<p>A good mobile app development company should have excellent UI/UX skills, but don&#8217;t just take their word for it. It&#8217;s worth downloading some of their apps to see how they actually work, as opposed to just nodding along to a selection of screenshots.</p>
<p>The apps should have great designs with excellent user interfaces. Pay attention to the small features, such as how neatly text fits into boxes and whether the buttons line up. Is the app easy to use? The tone consistent? It&#8217;s all in the detail. Little inconsistencies can ruin the whole feel of your app.</p>
<p>If possible, check client references. Look for app developers who can give you details of their previous clients. Ask these clients about the company&#8217;s ability to work to a deadline, overall value for money, general feedback and their willingness to recommend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 4: Cover All Bases</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never sign anything until you know exactly what services you will be paying for. Some app development companies will only develop, others will only design and some will do it all, from brand identity to QA testing.</p>
<p>Most clients find they want the same development company working on all aspects of the project. It ensures the team really get to know the brand, the design and the target market and would be in a better position to offer help with <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/quick-tips-post-app-launch-priorities/">post-launch marketing</a> if required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>Tip 5: Be Specific</u></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of being specific cannot be overemphasised. Without a clear understanding of the direction you want to take your project, there is very little your mobile app developers can do.</p>
<p>A good development company will listen intently to your project pitch, take notes and ask insightful questions, even bringing up potential problems your project may face before they arise.</p>
<p>When presented with a business requirement document, ensure you go through it thoroughly, line by line, before signing anything. This is no iTunes terms and conditions, a BRD is serious stuff and deserves your time. The more specific you are at the initial stages the better, as it means less changes will have to be made (which will cost you time and money) further down the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Be Realistic </span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App development doesn&#8217;t come cheap. It&#8217;s a huge investment which is why it&#8217;s so important to ensure you choose the right company. It is important however, not to be driven solely by price. Selecting a mobile app development company because they offer you the best price is not a good idea, and you may find that they cut corners further down the line.</p>
<p>While budgeting is highly important, cheaper options can end up costing more in the future. Don&#8217;t get ripped off, but don&#8217;t be a cheapskate either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 6: Consider A Local Agency</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not completely necessary, choosing a development company local to you can make designing and developing your project a hell of a lot easier. We regularly have clients come in to see us, sometimes to talk about the app, sometimes just for a decent cup of coffee and a chat about how our day is going.</p>
<p>All to often, feedback and comments can get lost in a stream of emails, making everyone&#8217;s lives more difficult. Plus, you can never really determine anyone&#8217;s true feelings via email, and there&#8217;s always a chance that something will get misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 7: Listen To Feedback</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your developers are friends, not foes. In an ideal world, the development team should give you feedback wherever possible, and it&#8217;s important that even if you don&#8217;t agree, you still take what they say onboard. Although you may disagree on certain aspects of the project and they will do their best to accommodate your preferences, remember that if you&#8217;ve hired the right app developers, they will have experience in creating <em>successful</em> apps. They will know the current trends in the App Store, the sorts of design that works and most fitting colour scheme for your brand. In fact, if your mobile app developers are quiet and repeatedly accommodating throughout your project, that&#8217;s when you should worry. No one&#8217;s idea is <em>that </em>good.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on giving constructive feedback to our clients, guiding them wherever possible into making the best decisions for their project. If you have a large team of app developers, ensure they give feedback on your idea and listen to what they have to say. Actually listen.</p>
<p>Chances are, they know better than anyone what works best and will want your app to succeed as much as you do.</p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 8: Have A Post-Launch Plan</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood, sweat and tears have paid off and now hooray, the app is finished! Although&#8230;it&#8217;s not finished.  It&#8217;s far from finished.</p>
<p>Your app is never actually &#8216;finished&#8217; and ensure your developers know this. There is always more to be done, whether it&#8217;s fixing bugs, developing new features for users or starting work on version two.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss maintenance and updates at the beginning of the process. Then, once the app is signed off and launched, get to work on making it even better. Having a maintenance plan in place at the start of the project means no one is caught off guard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s Wordwide Developers Conference kicked off yesterday and the event was, as expected, filled to the brim with new features, major announcements and not-so-subtle attempts to put Google back in their place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest announcements of the event so far:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HomePod</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Apple&#8217;s Siri speaker is finally here (well, in December).</p>
<p>It looks like an old Mac Pro, stands at a modest 7 inches tall and is powered by the A8 chipset. Users can use it in the same way they would Amazon Echo or Google Home, but Apple&#8217;s HomePod has a few little extras to make it stand out.</p>
<p>HomePod uses the A8 chip to monitor the space in the room and change its sound accordingly. The &#8216;Musicologist&#8217; feature works alongside Apple Music and can be accessed by talking to Siri &#8211; who can now handle complicated questions, play music on demand or send iMessages..</p>
<p>It will be available in black and white, and costs $349. A valiant effort but so far we can&#8217;t see it knocking Echo off the top spot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iOS 11</span></p>
<p>This is a big one for us as, let&#8217;s face it, we could spend hours exploring Apple&#8217;s latest iOS updates. Like every year, Apple showcased their latest iOS update and got the tongues wagging of mobile app developers all around the globe.</p>
<p>Packed full of new features, iOS 11 definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Siri&#8217;s voice is now much less robotic thanks to machine learning, and it&#8217;ll use on-device learning to improve users&#8217; iOS experiences. Siri will also speak in another language for you, which is great news for the 80% of Brits who communicate with non-English speakers by speaking English with a slightly foreign accent.</p>
<p>Siri is also learning to predict the users&#8217; next moves and will offer suggestions based on previous behaviours. It&#8217;ll learn interests, suggest related topics in News or will add related words to QuickType suggestions.</p>
<p>Other features in iOS 11 include the addition of person-to-person payments in Apple Pay and the ability to send money through iMessages. Photos and videos will take up less space, and a long exposure mode is being added to the camera. Apple Maps will be updated with lane guidance and speed limits displayed, as well as indoor maps of department stores. Users will be able to see what their friends are listening to on Apple Music (this has the potential to be mildly embarrassing), and the App Store is getting a total redesign and will look a lot more similar to the current layout of Apple Music.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WatchOS 4</span></p>
<p>Apple are adding several new faces, including a Siri face to the WatchOS 4. This face will automatically display the information which is most important to you and simply lifting your wrist will display this relevant information. This face will provide traffic information, reminders, news headlines and other location/time specific information.</p>
<p>The activity app is also getting updated. New workout challenges will be added, alongside a high intensity interval training mode. While we&#8217;re sceptical about the actual usefulness of fitness watches (read more <a href="http://borneagency.com/blogs/fitness-wearables/">here</a>), we&#8217;re glad to see Apple doing their bit to combat the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>However the most exciting feature of the WatchOS 4 is the Toy Story-related watchfaces. The new faces will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz Lightyear, and if that&#8217;s not the best piece of techie news you&#8217;ve heard this year than you need to take a long hard look at yourself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacOS 10.13 High Sierra</span></p>
<p>Although a bit of a mouthful, the new version of macOS has a number of useful improvements. Photos will be easier to sort through, with Apple allowing users to filter them by order or tag. Photo editor will also be much more user friendly, with new tools available such as Curve. Updates to Safari will help to block site trackers &#8211; meaning you won&#8217;t be plagued with headphone adverts for 10 months after you&#8217;ve actually bought the headphones.</p>
<p>Updates also include Apple&#8217;s new file system, APFS, which will make moving files around much quicker and simultaneously free up space.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.5 Inch iPad Pro </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually software that is announced at the WWDCs, so whenever a new piece of hardware is introduced, our app developers and designers will spend the next few days deciding who&#8217;s going to take one for the team and buy it first.</p>
<p>This year, Apple introduced the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro, featuring a 12-megapixel camera and a 7-megapixel selfie camera, alongside 10 hours of battery life. The large screen allows for a full size onscreen keyboard and it also supports HBR video. Apple Pencil will be more responsive thanks to the new ProMotion feature &#8211; which increases the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz.</p>
<p>Finally it features a six-core A10X Fusion Chip with a 30% CPU performance improvement and a 40% graphics improvement. Notes has a built in document scanner and tapping with the Apple Pencil will lead you directly to the Notes app.</p>
<p>The 10.5-inch iPAd Pro will start at 64GB and costs $649.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iMac Update</span></p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s updated the iMac line which has gone down a storm with our app designers who are already whipping out their credit cards while committing themselves to a life of porridge and packed lunches. The new line includes an iMac 21.50inch and iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inc, with better storage, screens and the latest Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen processors.</p>
<p>The latest iMacs are shipping now but don&#8217;t be too hasty, as Apple also announced the high-end iMac Pro with with a Space Grey finish, a 27-inch screen, 18 cores in its processor and 16GB of VRAM. Start saving!</p>
